            <div class="comment-text"><p>Jasper,</p>

<p>Thanks for your quick and thoughtful reply.  Please forgive my ignorance on these questions.</p>

<p>Are you saying Wireshark will explicitly show whether someone is using HTTP or HTTPS (or does that fact that you can read plain text tell you that it's HTTP)?  If HTTP, does that mean they are easily hacked?</p>

<p>Similarly, are you saying that surfing via a VPN would be less safe than not?  Will Wireshark show you whether they are on a VPN (or am  I again just looking for plain text)?</p>

<p>He has to present lots of data for the project (generally speaking, more data = better grade).  I'm thinking # of people using HTTP vs. HTTPS (or VPN vs not)?  Any thoughts on this?</p>

<p>Thanks again,
Ken</p></div>

            <div class="comment-text"><p>Hi Ken, sorry for the mess in the comments.</p>

<p>Yes, with Wireshark you can tell if someone is using HTTP or HTTPS, e.g. by filtering on TCP ports 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS). If HTTP, it means that anyone can read what is going on, and may potentially grab passwords, cookies, password hashes, user IDs etc. from it.</p>

<p>Surfing via VPN is more safe that without - all an eavesdropper can see is the encrypted channel, but not what's communicated inside of it. There are standard VPN protocols like IPSec (which Wireshark will list as protocol), and standard ports like UDP 1194 used by OpenVPN.</p>

<p>I think it would make sense to sample at least half a dozend of locations and count how many connections are encrypted, and what people are doing. # of HTTP connections vs. # of HTTPS connections and # of VPN connections, maybe as a breakdown per IP address (=devices/persons). For this the statistics functions of Wireshark are really helpful: endpoints (IP tab), conversations (IP tab) and protocol distribution.</p>

<p>Best would be to experiment with your own laptop first - capture with Wireshark while surfing to a HTTP site before surfing to an HTTPS site. Then try to spot which conversation in the capture is what. Keep in mind that web pages often contain multiple elements, which can lead to multiple connections.</p></div>

            <div class="comment-text"><p>Hi Jasper,</p>

<p>My son and I have been experimenting (at home) with Wireshark using his Dell laptop and my Surface Pro 4.  We can see the traffic we generate from our own PC's but can't seem to see each other's access to the web.  Is this because we would need the AirPCAP special adapater that you mentioned in your first reply?  If so, is it possible to simply monitor the volume of HTTP vs. HTTPS traffic without the adpater?</p>

Capturing in the air requires that your hardware and drivers support monitoring and promiscuous modes simultaneously, which is currently only "guaranteed" for Apple devices; on both Windows and Linux, it is a matter of luck but you may give it a try, using the guidelines in those other questions. On Windows, use of a version of NPcap which supports monitoring mode is just one of the prerequisites, the newest ones seem not to.</p></div>

<p>We have switched to a MacBook Pro and still don't seem to be picking up traffic other than the our own.  Basically, we start the capture, go to a website (i.e. mcdonalds.com) on an iPhone (connected to the same WiFi) and stop the capture.  Then, we apply a display filter that says 'tcp contains mcdonalds'; however there is nothing to see.  The Wifi connection is password protected but both the MacBook Pro and the iPhone have access.  I think we're doing something wrong - sorry, we're newbies at this.  Could you please give us some direction?</p>

<p>Thanks very much,
Ken</p></div>

Try filtering on "http.request" to see if there are any other GET/POST requests that aren't yours. Try specific websites that aren't encrypted if you can (meaning, starting with "http://" instead of "https://"). McDonalds seems to use HTTPS (surprise, but not a bad thing other than making things harder for you)</p>

<p>If not, check if you get anything when filtering for "tcp.port==80", and compare IP addresses with your own. You should be looking for TCP packets that are not involving your IP address.</p></div>

            <div class="comment-text"><p>A display filter <code>tcp contains "mcdonalds"</code> would only show something if it was possible for Wireshark to dissect the captured packets up to the tcp layer. For that, the WLAN either has to be open (no encryption used), or you have to provide Wireshark with enough information to decrypt it. As you wrote your home WLAN is password protected, read the wiki and threads regarding WLAN decryption. In short - in order to decrypt WPA successfully, you have to capture the key negotiation phase, the famous "4 EAPOL packets". So you must start capturing on the macbook in monitoring mode, switch WLAN off on the iPhone, switch it on again and then access the web site from the iPhone. Or you may switch off encryption of your WLAN for a while if your neighbours are not too quick. If, using one of the two methods above, you can see in the capture some packet which has a source IP address which is unicast and different from your PC and the access point while a display filter <code>tcp</code> is applied,  that address should be the iPhone's one and you've won.</p></div>

<p>We've finally been able to capture traffic from other devices - how cool! Thanks so much for all your help to this point.</p>

<p>We're learning the filter syntax to analyze the data. We know we can enter tcp.port==80 or tcp.port==443 to capture HTTP vs. HTTPS connections. Hoping you can help us with these questions:
1. What filter would allow us to excude our Apple MAC's traffic from the results using its IP address?
2. What filter would we enter to capture # of VPN connections?
3. How can we separate VPN connections from HTTP and HTTPS connections?
4. How do we break down the results per IP address (=devices/persons)?
5. We're struggling to understand how to utilize the Statistic tools to learn more about encrypted vs. non-encrypted connections. Can you give us some guidance, with the understanding that we are complete newbies at this and the end goal is to generate science fair data?</p>

<p>Just be aware that looking as deep as needed for the purpose into the traffic captured on a public place without the knowledge of the clients is quite likely to be illegal regardless the purpose.</p>

<p><code>!(wlan.addr == ur:ma:ca:dd:re:ss)</code></p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>What filter would we enter to capture # of VPN connections?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>You can filter individual packet by their properties, and there are several protocols used for VPN, so this is not a simple task. Some VPNs cannot be distinguished from https traffic because they basically are https traffic, some use GRE and some use UDP...</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How can we separate VPN connections from HTTP and HTTPS connections?
If you can see HTTP headers in some of the packets of a TCP session, it is likely to be a HTTP connection. If there is no clear text in any of the packets, it is either an encrypted connection or simply a protocol which uses some other than text encoding. TCP connections to port 443 are most often HTTPS connections but it is not an unbreakable law as said above, and TCP connections to port 80 are most often HTTP connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we break down the results per IP address (=devices/persons)?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>You can use <code>Statistic -&gt; IPv4 Statistics -&gt; All Addresses</code> and find the IP addresses assigned by the AP (they will usually be private ones) among them. To get IP addresses of all users of the WLAN you have catch the EAPOL negotiation for all of them.</p>

<p>I would have a problem myself to find anything like that, as the statistics do not go this deep, due to reasons provided in 2 and 3.</p>

<p>I would say that those clients which access TCP ports 110 (POP3) or 143 (IMAP) and 25 (SMTP) using plaintext (i.e. no starttls seen in the capture for these ports) do not care much about privacy, while those who use starttls on these ports or use ssl versions of the above protocols (995, 993, 465 respectively) do care about it. If the person doesn't do their e-mails, this doesn't help, so look for access to plain HTTP (port 80). A client which, except maybe for some DNS requests, sends and receives packets mostly to and from a single address is likely to be using some kind of VPN, tunnelling all its traffic through the VPN.</p></div>

The situation with public wifi is that it is unencrypted in most cases, to allow people to easily connect to it without having to ask for a password first. Which means that you can consider almost all public wifi locations unprotected, as anyone with a wifi card can capture everything everybody else does (e.g. with Wireshark). With Windows this would require a special adapter (AirPCAP), but on Linux or MacOS you can use almost any adapter.</p>
<p>What may be interesting to ask instead is "how well do people of public wifi protect themselves?" - this would be something your son could investigate using Wireshark. He'll need to read up and check for people surfing using HTTPS (encrypted HTTP, needs to be provided by the web page server, and the user needs to use it instead of HTTP) or surfing via a VPN (user responsibility to use one). To do that he could check how many plain text conversations he can find compared to how much encrypted stuff is found.</p>

<p>To be fair, only capturing your traffic and checking it thoroughly for clear text transmissions can give you a definitive result. You could filter for "tcp.port==80" to check if you're using HTTP instead of encrypted HTTPS.</p></div>
