<p>Basically I receive data at around 10KB/s when it slows down really bad. This seems to happen at any time of day, even at night when internet load is low. Normally tiles load pretty much instantly. This slow load also happen in the selection view in JOSM. Really annoying when trying to download an area to edit. Have to wait for a couple of minutes for the map tiles to load.</p>

<p>Transient problems like this are probably best discussed in IRC, where a sysadmin may be able to diagnose issues with the regional tile caches. #osm-dev on OFTC is the best place to ask.</p>
