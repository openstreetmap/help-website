<p>Hi todos !!</p>
<p>I used to edit maps on OpenstreetMap in order to view modifications on Strava (in route mode). Nothing I've added to OpenStreetMap in the past 4 weeks has made its way into Strava's map.</p>
<p>When I ask Strava here is they answer : "In regards of OpenStreetMaps and Map Box not updating, we rely on these changes to be approved first before they're pushed onto Strava. From that point was they're approved these maps will be updated periodically"</p>
<p>When I check OSM my modification are effective so I guess it is approved !</p>
<p>Anyone knows how it works between OSM and Strava ? Anyone knows what is Mapbox and how it works ? Is Mapbox in charge of any approbation ?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot. Jerome (France)</p>

<p>You'll need to ask MapBox directly, I think. They are <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">a company</a> that other companies use to provide maps for their websites and applications. Other companies offer similar services, and people can of course just use OSM data directly themselves, subject to the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">relevant terms</a>.</p>

<p>There's probably some confusion about "approving changes". Neither Mapbox nor anybody has enough manpower to approve worldwide OSM changes, at best they can rubberstamp at a particular snapshot of a particular area, but it'd be mad to do that at scale.</p>
<p>However Mapbox does have a "report error" tool which they filter in-house before eventually forwarding to OSM as a note. That's probably what Strava is talking about, but the OP is instead talking about a changeset he made himself.</p>

<p>Note that OSM has no "approval process". As soon as soon as you upload changes to OSM they are effective, no approval needed. Other contributors can then check out your modifications and decide on whether to question them or in case of actual vandalism revert them. As a longtime contributor to OSM I'm not even sure what kind of approval the Strava employee might be talking about here.</p>

<p>The maps used by Strava (and other companies) indeed appears not to have been updated for some time now (I'm seeing some of my own modifications missing too). This is not due to any modifications to OSM data not being "approved" however. Mapbox merely produces maps based on OSM data and somehow their rendering proces must have stopped or slowed down significantly.</p>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your answer ! I am pretty suret hat MAPBOX is in charge of the update. In the past when I choosed "Update this map" in the map screen of STRAVA and you go directly to OSM website. From September you got now a new tool "© Mapbox" beside the "© OpenStreetMap" which forward directly to mapbox.</p>
<p>Anyway I've sent an e-amil to mapbox waiting for an explanation.</p>
<p>This situation will occurs that somes users like me will not edit anymore... :-(</p>

<p>I'm seriously surprised to see a response like that from Mapbox. Take this fuel station that I updated 4 weeks ago: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/293703077.">https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/293703077.</a> It's still not visible on Mapbox maps. This will just lead to Mapbox falling behind seriously. Curiosly I haven't seen Mapbox team members make edits in my country for quite some time now. What's going on?</p>

<p>Here is the answer of MAPBOX... it seems that their speed of analysis is not very effective !</p>
<p>"Hey Jerome,</p>
<p>Edits that go to OpenStreetMap are not directly applied to Mapbox maps right away. We care a lot about the accuracy of our maps and that is why we have a data team that works hard to validate all incoming OSM edits. We can't guarantee a timeframe for edits to appear but we appreciate your contribution and will continue to work hard to make sure our maps are up-to-date.</p>

<p>I noticed exactly the same : my edits do not appear anymore on Mapbox maps (including the ones on Strava website).</p>
<p>This is the answer I go from Mapbox support : <em>Because we validate community changes, edits to OSM do not instantly appear on our maps and are at our discretion. We can't guarantee a timeframe for edits to appear but we appreciate your feedback and will continue to work hard to make sure our maps are up-to-date. If you run into any more issues with edits not appearing, our Mapbox Feedback Tool is the best place to inform us what needs to be fixed. Best Nadia</em></p>
<p>Then now I have to do my work twice : enter my edits in OSM then use the "improve this map" button.</p>
<p>Then my edits appear.</p>
<p>I find it extremely inconvenient and hope that they will change this as soon as possible. Each time I indicate that my HDYC index is quite high and that they could trust me, but I got no feedback from them until now.</p>

<p>Here the last explanation from Strava :</p>
<p>"Hello Jérõme, Sorry about the inconvenience but we rely on Open Street Map and Map Box for the updates that are pushed to Strava. In terms of map updates it's true that they've slowed down updates to maps. It's so they can improve vital parts of the data infrastructure and put in place some more vandalism protection. However if there are specific updates you’re concerned about, please flag them so the Data team can prioritize them in the queue. Again sorry about the inconvenience. Best, Rañola Strava Support Team "</p>
<p>As said Christouf0676 the only way seems to enter edits in OSM then use the "improve this map" button from MAPBOX. (I will try this in the future)</p>
<p>The MAPBOX "validation process" is directly due to the supposed "vandalism protection" which Strava speaks ! Is there a real vandalism on OSM ? Would it be just an excuse to master our editions and why not take ownership of the changes ? This situation is not clear and as usual Strava is still very imprecise and does not give the reasons for this change of course...</p>

<p>From what I heard from the Strava support, Mapbox is currently working on an "anti-vandalism" system, and will start again to import changes from OSM when it will be operationnal.

<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/14297/christouf0676">@Christouf067</a> I wouldn't set too much store by that video - many of "The data team at Mapbox" to which it refers <a href="https://developmentseed.org/blog/2017/12/19/devseed-data/">no longer work</a> for Mapbox. The good news is that there are lots of other options for getting at OSM data and OSM maps that enable you to have up to date maps. If an app or map that you were using is showing out of date data, use a different one.</p>

<p>My own experience was that it took about 4 weeks for a change I made to update to Strava and RidewithGPS, but eventually it did update, much to my eventual satisfaction.</p>

<p>I raised this on the Strava Support forum in August 2018 and one of the responses suggested that although Mapbox have incorporated changes, Strava have not updated their map tiles for some time. <a href="https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360019440271-Mapbox-maps-not-updated-from-OpenStreetMap-recently-">https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360019440271-Mapbox-maps-not-updated-from-OpenStreetMap-recently-</a></p>
<p>veloviewer offers a range of map layers, including OSM-derived tiles which are updated quickly, but requires a paid subscription.</p>
