<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I was wondering if an algorithm exists which will compare buildings in OSM with another dataset and tell whether that building in OSM is on the right side of the road.</p>
<p>An idea would be to: 1) get the address a building, 2) from the address get the road the building is on, 3) then get the polygon for the road, 4) then use the coordinates for the building in the reference dataset to determine the side of the road the building is on, 5) Then use the OSM coordinates for that building to determine what side of the road it is on 6) compare the two results, 7) This would be part of a broader idea of constructing a similarity measure and using this test as a component to rank similarity,</p>
<p>I have read up on a number of similarity measures but haven't yet found something that discusses this idea. While I have the idea in mind, I would like to prepare the code in R and was hoping to see code for a similar algorithm in R that I could use as a reference.</p>
<p>If you have come across something similar, if possible including R code, could you please advise ?</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>
