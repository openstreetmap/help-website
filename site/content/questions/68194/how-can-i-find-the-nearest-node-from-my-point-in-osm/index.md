<p>I want to get the distance of the nearest node for each amenity such as hospital and bank.</p>
<p>Now, I'm using <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API#Around">around</a></p>
<p>to get every node in a specific radius. But I don't know how far the nearest hospital or bank is. It can be 5 km, 10 km or more than 100 km. I decide to set it to be infinity if there are no any amenity in the area. This affects my valuation model to have less accuracy. So, I want to get the number of distance no matter how far it is.</p>
<p>How can I do that?</p>

<p>Hey did you find a solution to this? I am also trying to do something similar although I can have a set radius instead of infinity. I simply want to find the distance to the nearest hospital from a specific co-ordinate with a given radius.</p>
<p>As for your valuation model, Surely over a particular distance, the presence of a hospital or bank does not really have an impact? You could simply set the radius as very high?</p>
<p>But you may be going for something completely different here and I may be mistaken.</p>
