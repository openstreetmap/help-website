<p>Carefully, I would say: yes, if it is a doublette house number, you can delete it on the defibrillator.</p>
<p><strong>But before</strong>, please tell us the perma link to that object, so that we can inspect in detail.</p>
<p>Maybe there has been a kind of import of defi locations where each one has addr: data ...</p>
<p>so we have to check first.</p>

<p>Here is the link to the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/30381039">changeset</a>, the defibrillators in question I have already changed are: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3134128633/history">Defibrillator 1 history</a> and <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3134128629/history">Defibrillator 2 history</a>, <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3134117325/history">Defibrillator 3 history</a>.</p>
<p>You are right with your guess, they have been imported as you can see from the history pages. Sadly I have no idea how to go on from here. Any suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>I beleive it is best to duplicate unless a relation is in use to bind both references. In rendering it might not be such a problem but with data use the following applies:-</p>
<p>I'd suggest that in general if an object has been given a set of specific address tags that they may be being used in a data sort were the address is clearly available after a text based search.</p>
<p>To explain imagine you took the raw xml data version of OSM and put it into either a database or simply a text editor then asked the program to find all of the kind of object your looking for say [find] "k=emergency, v=defibrillator" then all the defibrillators in the extract can come up along with all the other tags close by so it is easy to find all there addresses to put into a table to give to people. If you did [find] "k=emergancy, v=defibrillator" &amp; "k=addr:country, v=AT" &amp; "k=addr:city, v=Wien" &amp; "k=addr:district, v=5." then the list made could give all building addresses in district "5." which is a useful thing to be able to do.</p>
<p>If you remove the parts of the address because they seem duplicated then consider do the two references have a logical linking connection in the data, say with a reference or relation if not unless the algorithm to find can be made to search any object nearby as a possible address to correspond to then it is very difficult for a program to make a simple list for defibrillators users anymore.</p>
<p>So remembering data uses don't plot things out to use them it would make sense to leave the addresses intact and only make a correction if it is incomplete or wrong through contradiction with another addressed object. If possible visit the place to see what was the wrong one {remember people move things and draw things into OSM at different times and with varying offsets so it may be numbered for next door because it still is next door!}</p>

<p>having looked agin at your examples I wonder how many renderers look for entrance tags to building numbers at the moment? It dose come to rendering style I guess if some one prefers to be able to put the number in the middle of the building by automaticly having the number linked with the building area's [way]</p>

<p>here is an example area I tried both styles in (I think I either ran out of time or had a confermation problem probably the first so it was only part done before I was had a lot of the local bits deleted (apperently for a better look in a renderer tut-tut (renders should be programed to filter the bits they need and reget what users don't like in the funal render)) so I may have abandoned that spot for a bit. <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=20/51.75076/-1.23757&amp;layers=HD">https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=20/51.75076/-1.23757&amp;layers=HD</a></p>
