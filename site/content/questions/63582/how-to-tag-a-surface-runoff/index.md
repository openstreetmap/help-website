<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/8189/alester">@alester</a> In France, there is a legal distinction between surface runoff and stream ; one of the three criteria to consider a "waterway" as a stream is the existence of a source. This distinction is important because it has some impact on local agricultural policy and I think it's important to think about it when we build a map.</p>

<p>I would not map surface runoff, everywhere is runoff when it rains isn't it? If the the area was always wet and boggy then map as marsh or wetland. Man made ditches are usually straight and on the edges of fields or natural brooks or streams can be mapped. If we were to map smaller than this the map would be all small blue threads wouldn't it? Many, maybe most streams and rivers in populated areas have over the years been rerouted for farm land drainage, irrigation, navigation and power for water mills. Staunching ( low dam ) and hand dug channels that lead a stream off, do after a few storms erode into something that will look natural. I would suggest that any river with locks or weirs is not natural even though i/we do map them as natural water.</p>

<p>Hi pico51, did you consider using natural=wetland as source of the stream since you stated it is not a brook. That’s what happening the water runs into the (grass) or rocky field and at a moment it is running as a little stream. With the appropriate tags for water running every now and then.</p>

<p>I think waterway=ditch is used for artificial waterways but here <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/15142/pico51">@Pico51</a> is talking about a natural non-permanent waterway made of rain waters.

<p>I don't see that <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/15142/pico51">@Pico51</a> has mentioned whether it's natural or non-natural. This is a distinction best figured out via survey so I don't know the definite right answer. However, one indicator of non-natural waterways via imagery is if a waterway has many straight segments and hard angles. This waterway looks much straighter and more angular than the stream Le Bonrupt to the northeast, which makes me suspect it's non-natural.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/5390/escada">@escada</a>: on the wiki, waterway=drain and waterway=ditch are both artificial, and the difference is mostly size (also possibly lining). That seems to have been the definition since at least 2011.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/595/neuhausr">@neuhausr</a> It's definitely a natural waterway. It starts inside a field and the water is carried by the ground until the road. I guess the best definition for it is waterway=brook but it is marked as disputed so I don't know if it's a good idea to use it.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/15142/pico51">@pico51</a>: there is no real difference in british english between stream and brook. There are numerous other words used in english for streams (gill, beck, burn, water). Where I live most streams have "Brook" in their name. Therefore trying to introduce some semantic difference between waterway=stream and waterway=brook in OSM is rather foolhardy.</p>
<p>The correct way forward is to add one or more additional tags to handle the situation of surface runoff. A fairly obvious option would be to specify the water source: assuming the default to be groundwater (i.e., arising from a spring) and therefore not needing tagging, some options might be surface_runoff, glacial_meltwater, cave_system (for subterranean waterways in karst landscapes), etc.</p>

<p>I am interested, how did you map the first 400 metres i can't see anything on bing or digital globe other than what looks like cultivated farmland.
