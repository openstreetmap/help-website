<p>I have KMZ files that need to be uploaded to Maps.me. I know others have been able to do it with their Apple phones. Mine is Android.</p>
<p>I clicked on the file and it states no app can upload and yet I have Maps.me.</p>
<p>I saw this online: Tap the file with bookmarks (KML or KMZ format) ‚Üí choose "Open with MAPS.ME" in the pop-up window (if you have no other apps that support KML files, the file will be instantly open in MAPS.ME).</p>
<p>However, this is not the case. It does not open instantly or at all.</p>
<p>I left my issue on Play Store and the response was to contact OSM.org... Hence why I'm here.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>What do you want to does with the KMZ? You can display them with some Garmin GPSes ( called garmin custom maps), Garmin Basecamp will also display one on a Win PC or and probably a Mac. Google Earth will also overlay a KMZ.</p>

<p>I am a Medic who needs lease/site maps to get to various locations of need be. We are in a remote area so the consultants have emailed us kmz/kml files to export/bookmark into Maps.me.</p>
<p>I have to use my Android phone.</p>
<p>Maps.me claims it can be done and I know my fellow coworkers have done it on their Apple phones.</p>
<p>I'd really appreciate some troubleshooting rather than extra confusing apps, sites and info. I'm not what they call tech savvy. But thanks for the effort! üëçüèº</p>

<p>Hello I just tried with a kmz file from the internet using android and it worked. I downloaded to my downloads on the phone, then I browsed to the file and tapped it. A list of apps popped up of the ones capable of opening it along with mapsme in the list. I selected Mapsme and it opened fine.</p>

<p>Okay, so this is years too late, probably, but I just opened a KML file today using Maps.me. It was a file I downloaded off a cycle.travel webpage. First, I downloaded the KML file to my phone. I probably could have done this directly, but I did this by downloading the file to my computer first, then attaching the file I needed to an email that I sent to myself. Then, I opened the email on my phone and downloaded the file so it was on my android phone. Note that I was not able to click and open the file from the email link in my email. I had to click to download the file to my phone. Then, when I clicked to open the KML file I saw a Maps.Me screen that said I'd find it as a bookmark. Sure enough, when I opened Maps.me and clicked the "star"/bookmark symbol on the left-hand side of the screen I saw my file there. I clicked to open it and there it was. I hope this isn't too late and that it helps someone.</p>
