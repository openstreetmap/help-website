<p>I have this slideshow creation program, which has a feature called, "Travel Route Animation". It is supposed to work with OpenStreetMap. However, when I try to access this feature, a browser opens that should connect to OpenStreetMap, but is unable to connect. Have you heard of this problem from anyone else? Magix's support team has not been able to resolve this issue. I have no problem connecting to your site, outside of their program. I am using windows 7, 64bit.</p>

<p>Sorry, you are wrong here, however, it is great that you are interested in OpenStreetMap!<br />
</p>
<p>No, there is no further mention of <span>Magix on this site</span>. If Magic support cannot resolve that issue.. well - who else? We (99,99% of "us") don't even know that program (which, additionally, is probably closed source) and how it "connects" to OpenStreetMap. Magix should be able to fix their stuff. If there is a problem at OSM they could contact OSM with specific information what goes wrong. Maybe some other <span>OSM-based service</span> is suitable for you.</p>
<p>[Update:] You could <span>search the whole openstreetmap.org domain for magix</span> (I already have filtered out a discussion about "Lizenzverstöße"). Maybe you find some helping info there. Furthermore: if the program does not work as advertised you maybe could return it to the seller.[/Update]</p>
<p>I suggest to close this question for being off-topic.</p>

<p><span>@quadrantg</span>: really? A link from their program pointed you to this site? Depending on how this link is labelled that may be wrong by magix. <span>This site is about OSM</span> (mainly about contribution to OSM data) and not about supporting third-party programs which use OSM.</p>
