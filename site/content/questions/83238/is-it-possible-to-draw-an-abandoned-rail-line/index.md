By the time of the Second World War, 90% of the project had been completed, with clear train tracks, bridges, tunnels, stations, and other building.When the Second World War began in 1940, however, constructions halted and construction sites were destroyed<a href="https://osrslab.com/osrs-fletching-guide/">.</a>For any number of reasons, the new Greek government abandoned the entire project, regardless of how close it was to completion.It is possible to see where the train would have gone if the constructions had been completed, even though the project was still in its early stages until then.</p>
