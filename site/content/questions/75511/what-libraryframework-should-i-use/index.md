<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I am creating an application where I would like to use openstreetmap but I am a completely novice. I have taken a look at the help wiki, specifically the framework section as well as the "Databases and data access APIs" but I am completely lost about what service/framework whatsoever I should use.</p>
<p>Ideally I would like to be able to have my own instance in my server. Right now I am using the open API of Nominatim where I can grab an address, but I know I can install it in my own server if necessary.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to for example, search for the shops or museums around 5 km of one address in the back-end. Such a thing cannot be done with Nominatim and therefore, this is when openstreetmap can help me or I believe so.</p>
<p>Please, could someone guide me about what could I use or where I could find answers to my questions?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance and regards</p>

<p>What do you mean by "your own instance"; just that you will host your own copy of OSM data? Is your end goal just to be able to search for nearby POIs, or...?</p>

<p>I mean to host a service in my localhost, like I could do with Nominatim but for OSM. My end goal in the back-end is to search nearby POIs and also know the distance between them. Thank you!</p>

<p>I don't know of any publicly available frameworks to do this, but as a hint: Geoapify offers this in their Places API (bounding by travel time), so as a combination of an isoline or isochrome function (possibly based on valhalla isochrome) and poi search. Test it here: <a href="https://apidocs.geoapify.com/playground/places">https://apidocs.geoapify.com/playground/places</a> (tick "Search by isoline").</p>
<p>Nominatim only offers a poi search by bounded box or administrative place afaik, not by radius or the like.</p>
<p>(Try e.g. "bakery in delft": <a href="https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search.php?q=bakery+in+delft+&amp;polygon_geojson=1&amp;viewbox=">https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search.php?q=bakery+in+delft+&amp;polygon_geojson=1&amp;viewbox=</a> )</p>
<p>So you either have to rebuild the places api as offered by geoapify through PostGIS functions or lower your expectations in using the bounded box variation already present in Nominatim.</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay answering. I think I have different requirements, which I could summarize in two:</p>
<p>1.First one would be the ability to render maps; I mean, if I use leaflet, I need to make a query to "https://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png". I would like to have my own "tile" instance in my server. What technology/Framework do I need to use? I think this is called "map rendering"?? 2. I have a list of POI (lat, lng), I need to calculate the distance between them. 3. Besides of point 2, I would also like to query my database of POIs in order to search for POIs close to certain place (lat, lng). For example, if I have a POI in a city I would like to be able to search for POI in a city close to that one.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this is possible, I am experienced developing SW but I have zero knowledge of maps, and so on.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
