<p>I added a few restaurants in my town using iD editor. At first the changes were taken into account within minutes and shown on OSM.org, but after that it stopped showing, and edits I've done 20 hours ago are still not shown.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of is that at first I was using commit messages (like "Added restaurant XXX"), but after a few edits I realized the changes were already listed by iD so I stopped providing a commit message. Could that impact the time taken for a change to be validated?</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/30078683">an edit (new restaurant) with a commit message.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/30085598">an edit (new restaurant as well) without a commit message</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks in advance for your feedback!</p>

<p>Both restaurants appear when I look at the area. Perhaps the tiles are cached by your browser, so reload the page.</p>
<p>The moment the items appear on the map depends o.a. on the load of the server, the zoom level. It has nothing to to with the commit message.</p>
<p>On the other hand it is good practice to give a commit message, aka changeset comment. Preferable the comment should tell the other contributors how you know about the feature : local knowledge, survey, tracing from bing, ... The fact that you added a restaurant can be deduced from the data in the changeset and is therefore less interesting. However for larger changes, it is easier to understand what was changed when that is mentioned as well.</p>

<p>Thanks! It was just a local cache issue as you mention. I thought I had pressed Ctrl+F5 but apparently I hadn't. Thanks for the tips for commit messages I will try to follow this from now.</p>
