<p>We have a rather strange problem with OSM.</p>
<p>We need to install an interactive map for a specific area on our site, but we lack the usual export module, which is accessible by a separate key inside the OSM site.</p>
<p>We would like to find out how we can copy a certain area of the map by its coordinates, and so that in addition we can use all its features, such as a beautiful renderer, and not a lot of objects on a white background, notes on the map, as well as the possibility of using the OSMR routing service.</p>
<p>At the moment, after exporting, we only get the designations on the map, without a schematic background, which is presented on the official website as a standard layer.</p>
