<p>I want to have this clear before uploading any "big" *.osm, to no revert any change other user would do. I don't know how to look for this in the Wiki, forum or anything. If this information is somewhere, please, tell me where.</p>

<p>No, his change will <strong>not</strong> be reverted. If however, your edits touches some of the same objects, which he edited, you will encounter conflicts, which you will have to resolve before you can succesfully upload your changes.</p>

<p>If you try to upload a .osm file and others have made edits in that same area, that will create disagreement about which version is correct. In the JOSM editor, that disagreement is called a "conflict" and you will need to resolve it in favor of either your version or the other mapper's version before you will be allowed to upload your data.</p>
<p>JOSM will pop up a conflict editor window where the nodes in question are resolved one by one. This is a tedious process and in my experience best avoided if at all possible. If you must work offline, use small areas and upload your edits as often as you can to prevent these conflicts from occurring.</p>

<p>Are you sure about this? I think JOSM stores in the OSM file whether an object was changed or not, and only the changed and new objects are uploaded.</p>
<p>I tried to edit an OSM file directly some time ago, and then use JOSM to upload it, but because I didn't change the 'edited' qualifiers, JOSM refused to upload 'no changes'.</p>
<p>Of course, if the asker edited the same object as another used had edited in the meantime, you would indeed get an error, but for other objects, I suppose it will not bother with the existing data.</p>

<p>But if the edit is in something that I haven't edit, I do'nt have to compare it isn't it? An JOSM at least will zoom in to the thing that has change.</p>
<p>I'm editing quite a big area, mapping a lot of buildings, it's more confortable to me to have a big *.osm that I can look a lot of times and correct in time that correcting after or don't knowing which chunk have you revised or which hasen't, instead of downloading again this chunk with an error, and upload it again (?)</p>

<p>To clarify what I said above. Only nodes that have been changed by another mapper since your last update or upload will generate conflicts. Nodes that neither of you have touched will not cause a conflict no matter now big an area you are working on.</p>

<p>Correct, objects you haven't edited will not cause conflicts. When you are adding new objects you won't get a conflict either because there is no previous version to disagree with. However, as SomeoneElse points out, you should check each of your additions to make sure another mapper hasn't already added a building in that same place.</p>

<p>Ctrl+U is the keyboard shortcut for File&gt;Update. Choosing Update by either method tells JOSM to update only those objects that have not been modified by you during the current session.
