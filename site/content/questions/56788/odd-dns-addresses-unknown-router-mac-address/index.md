You should see different MAC addresses for different SSIDs which are configured on your router <strong>simultaneously</strong>. Therefore:</p><ul><li><p><strong>replacing</strong> one SSID with another one doesn't change the MAC address</p></li><li><p><strong>adding</strong> another SSID does add another MAC address.</p></li></ul><p>I don't know your ISP's habits, but it can often be seen these days that if you buy an (especially cable-) ISP-provided router, it comes pre-configured with</p><ul><li><p>one SSID which any customer of the same ISP can use while visiting you, knowing his own passphrase,</p></li><li><p>another SSID which is used for Voice over IP devices,</p></li><li><p>yet another SSID which you use for your own non-VoIP devices.</p></li></ul></div><div id="comment-56803-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(29 Oct '16, 02:42)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="56832"></span><div id="comment-56832" class="comment"><div id="post-56832-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>do you have any thoughts on the DNS?</p></blockquote><p>Nope.</p><blockquote><p>I figured that implied that the cloned mac address would correspond to one SSID and another mac address would correspond to another SSID.</p></blockquote><p>This is what I've seen everywhere so far, due to the fact that at least older Microsoft Windows wireless clients couldn't cope with two SSIDs sharing the same MAC address.</p><p>As you say that both your SSIDs share the same MAC address, it seems your router behaves different. But in that case, I'm slightly surprised that it bothers to create a locally administered address for this purpose.</p><blockquote><p>Now, are you saying that beyond these two Wifi networks, there are possibly more SSIDs</p></blockquote><p>If you can see more SSIDs in the air, you can also check their MAC addresses. But if the router uses any other SSIDs than the two you've set up yourself, you would see them on the same channel and with the same signal strength like your two.</p></div><div id="comment-56832-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(30 Oct '16, 08:45)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="56843"></span><div id="comment-56843" class="comment"><div id="post-56843-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Thank you for your help and for answering my questions.
