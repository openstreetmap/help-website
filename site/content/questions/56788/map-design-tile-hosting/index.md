<p>Dear OSM-Community, I have got some questions regarding creating an website including a slippy map and the option to export svg-files. I am pretty new to … well, pretty much development stuff in general and OSM an particular. (I did use OSM and even some edits in the past.) Hence please excuse if the answer to my question might seem so obvious I would not even have had to ask it; in fact it's more about reaussuring myself of what I think to already know.</p>
<p>Anyhow the question is wether or creating a custom map design necessarily means I would have to host my own tiles or, respectively, have them hosted? If so, how much Data are we talking about for say … Western Europe?</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your help!</p>

<p>There are commercial options - have a read of <a href="https://switch2osm.org/providers/">https://switch2osm.org/providers/</a> if you want to pay someone to do it for you. If you want to sent things up yourself, <a href="https://switch2osm.org/manually-building-a-tile-server-16-04-2-lts/">https://switch2osm.org/manually-building-a-tile-server-16-04-2-lts/</a> .</p>
<p>Doubtless someone who's running a tile server for Western Europe will be able to chip in on the server spec required for that.</p>
