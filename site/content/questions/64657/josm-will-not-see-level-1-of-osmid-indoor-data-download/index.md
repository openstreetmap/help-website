<p>Hello, I am new to JOSM but lately, have been using it extensively at my job to map locations for a navigation system we are developing.<br />
We are mapping the venues who want this technology in OSM using ID Indoor. I am going back to edit a map I did months ago using the native iD editor, but now using JOSM. I cannot get the data from OSM, level -1 to show up in the JOSM data download. I have my filters set up only for levels, nothing else. They are written, ex: "level 1", "level 0" etc . . . I would like to know if anyone has had this issue and what the workaround is? I have gone back and checked other jobs I have done with "level -1" in ID Indoor, and none of the -1 levels show up in JOSM. I prefer working in JOSM but this could be a big issue for us moving forward, if we cannot see -1 levels. This is the link in question:</p>
