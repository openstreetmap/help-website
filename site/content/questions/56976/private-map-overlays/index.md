<p>Last week, I was talking with a park manager about using and updating OSM for their park programs. They were initially interested, but what they initially wanted to do was to create a map specific for their programs. The park would be divided into sectors, labeled Sector 1, Sector 2, and so on. The sectors had no visible boundaries, but the park always used them for their programs.</p>
<p>I would like to get this park manager using OSM, because they are currently updating their park maps through a local CAD program. They could be updating OSM instead.</p>
<p>How do other organizations use private map overlays? I did not see any way to do this through the OSM web interface. I know JOSM can save and load layers that do not get uploaded to the server, for one, but I have not been able to get JOSM on his computer, yet.</p>
<p>I assume this is something that many, many organizations do to use the OSM information for their own purposes. So, how are other people doing this? Thanks for sharing your ideas.</p>

<p>In addition to SomeoneElse's comment - umap is Open Source and if someone wanted their map overlay to be so private that not even umap knows of it, they could always set up a private instance of the software.</p>
