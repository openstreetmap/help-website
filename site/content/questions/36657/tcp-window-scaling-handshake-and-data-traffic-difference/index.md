The conclusion is that if one side supports TCP Window Scaling and the other does not it will not be used at all.</p><p>However I'm wondering why I'm still seeing scaled window size in the traffic following the initial handshake? If it's not being used at all, why is the client still advertising it?</p><p>I see two possible scenarios:</p><ol><li>The client is oblivious to the fact that the server is not using TCP Window Scaling and thus keeps on using it. This could be in conflict with the conclusion found elsewhere, but in all honesty I have not seen a capture where the server actually needed to transfer data back to the client and thus never having the need to fill the window.</li><li>The client does indeed stop using TCP Window Scaling after the handshake, since the server did not support it, but Wireshark picked up the TCP Option for Window Scaling in the SYN and "remembers" that for the TCP stream in question. I consider this to be slightly confusing if true.</li></ol><p>Finally, this does not seem at all seem to be related to the problem at hand; after doing a number of captures, it is clear in all of them. Wireshark version used: 1.12.1 Clients: Mac OS X 10.9.4 and Windows 7.</p><p>Help is appreciated - especially if I'm completely missing the obvious :-)</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags"><span class="post-tag tag-link-scaling" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;scaling&#39;">scaling</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-window" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;window&#39;">window</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-tcp" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;tcp&#39;">tcp</span></div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>27 Sep '14, 13:35</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a55fd7d0ca800a3b0724f350dbfec0b?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="NJL&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>NJL</span><br />
