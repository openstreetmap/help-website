You are supposed to use Wireshark to extract from the captured packets the html document which the client has requested initially (which the teacher seems to call a Base HTML file), and to find how many http:// links (to other objects to be rendered in the browser window) are inside that document.</p></div><div id="comment-53507-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 Jun '16, 14:49)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="53537"></span><div id="comment-53537" class="comment"><div id="post-53537-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I think he wants "HTTP Get request messages"</p></div><div id="comment-53537-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(17 Jun '16, 08:36)</span> Omar Ramadan</div></div><span id="53581"></span><div id="comment-53581" class="comment"><div id="post-53581-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Well, I'd guess that if he explicitly asks "how many things from the base HTML file", there would be a catch that there would be also additional http GETs in the capture which would not be triggered by the contents of the base file. So he probably wants you to use the feature of Wireshark which allows you to export the base file from the packet exchange, and to analyse its contents for references to other "things" (pictures, style files, flash animations, whatever).</p></div><div id="comment-53581-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(21 Jun '16, 01:35)</span> sindy</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-53349" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-53349-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
