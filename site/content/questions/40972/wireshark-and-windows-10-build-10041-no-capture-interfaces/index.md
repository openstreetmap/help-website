I encountered the same problems. I noticed my ethernet adapter had shown up in wireshark now after creating a Virtual Switch in Hyper-V (Included on Windows 10) that uses an External interface on my Ethernet adapter. Once this was created, for whatever reason, my ethernet adapter became an interface again for wireshark.</p><p>To Replicate: - Install Hyper-V feature and open it - Open Virtual Switch Manager and create a switch for "External Network" using your ethernet adapter and ensure "Allow management operating system to share this network adapter" is checked. - Click OK (adapter will create) - Launch Wireshark - Ethernet adapter should be present.</p><p>I can't guarantee this will work for everyone but it worked for me and I cannot explain why :-/</p><p>I can't attach screenshots because of Karma because I just signed up however here are links to screenshots. 1: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6J5HXP6P8uceF8wWFVNa2N2VVU/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6J5HXP6P8uceF8wWFVNa2N2VVU/view?usp=sharing</a> 2: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6J5HXP6P8ucR1pvaGw4cEZXb2c/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6J5HXP6P8ucR1pvaGw4cEZXb2c/view?usp=sharing</a> 3: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6J5HXP6P8ucWm9xTUxsdjJzNWc/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6J5HXP6P8ucWm9xTUxsdjJzNWc/view?usp=sharing</a></p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>22 Apr '15, 11:07</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e85f473c2e4782bc5980b3083b8e713c?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="mikeullar&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>mikeullar<br />

It should show you the active network interfaces on your device. If you've disabled any network interfaces, make sure to turn them on from 'device manager'.

But, WinPCap &amp; npcap are not standard features in the distribution as of yet. So, I had to look for other options to use Wireshark to detect packets causing possible DDOS attacks(ICMP Flood,ACK Flood &amp; SYN Flood) to my IP which reflected on my router. So, I tried all options I could find on the internet but to no avail until I stumbled upon Win10PCap which did the trick for me thereafter. So, you might be speaking from updates &amp; news but I'm the one to have experienced it personally and practically. I've no idea why you guys try to be trolls reading up articles on the internet. Why not learn from the viewpoint of the person and try to acknowledge the fact that they are speaking from their experience using it!
