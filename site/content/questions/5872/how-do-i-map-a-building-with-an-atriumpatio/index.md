<p>I have been browsing through the OSM-Inspector tool and it has come to my attention that many buildings in southern Europe still have internal courtyards (Atriums to the ancient Romans / Patios to the Spanish, I think, Innenhof to the Germans). Mappers are often using ways with overlapping sides to map this feature which creates a failure in OSM-Inspector. I would have thought that the best way to map these buildings would be to create a multipolygon for the building ie. outer and map the courtyard as landuse=courtyard or atrium or patio but I could not find anything in the map features or proposed features page. So I have come to the conclusion that I am missing something. What is it?</p>

<p>Yes, I know that. But what tag/attribute do I give the inner? With the above diagram, I know that I must generate a multipolygon with two elements; one as outer the second smaller one as inner. The outer defines the multipolygon as building=yes. The inner requires a valid tag like landuse=garden but the point is: It is not a garden it is a ??????. Is ?????? a courtyard or an atrium? Atrium is probably wrong as it defines a covered space within a modern building complex. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(architecture)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(architecture)</a></p>

<p>The ways does not have to have any tags at all. All building= <em>and addr</em> tags go on the relation. If you are unsure of the inner polygon leave that way without any tags. See the pentagon <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/relation/89605">https://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/relation/89605</a> for reference.</p>
<p>An atrium with a covered glass ceiling should be considered as part of the surounding building as it is part of the roof structure.</p>

<p>Thank you for the prompt answer. I was unaware that objects can have no tags. I suppose the renderers can cope with them somehow and the validators should be ignored.</p>

<p><span>@dcp</span>: Actually, it's true that usually objects without tags are useless, because they do not mean anything. The exception are objects which are part of a relation. These can be without tags, because the tags are on the relation (though the relation members can have tags of their own if appropriate).</p>
