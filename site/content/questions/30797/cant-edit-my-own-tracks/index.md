<p>I got to the OSM website, login and click EDIT on the map I zoom in as much as it require and than try to click on one of my previous mapped routes.</p>
<p>When I hoover with my mouse I can see details on the left but clicking on the route won't do anything.</p>
<p>I'm using chrome (latest) with windows 8.1 and Java is installed.</p>

<p>Hmm, could you please provide a link to one of those "routes"/"paths" which are not clickable? A <span>marker link</span> or link to an <span>object page</span> would be helpful.</p>
<p>A side note: If you just click on "edit" (and using the default user settings) you are using the "iD" editor. It does not need Java, by the way. If you have it installed you really should disable the Java plugin in the browser for security reasons. Our advanced editor JOSM only needs Java on your computer but no Java plugin in the browser.</p>
