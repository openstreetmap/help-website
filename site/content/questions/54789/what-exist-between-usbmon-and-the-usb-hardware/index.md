I am finally using wireshark with USB! Cheers!</p><p>Here is my problem: I am developing a Linux USB V4L2 driver for some hardware. My driver sends some bulk messages to the hardware when the driver is probed. I see those bulk messages on wireshark during capturing. Now the hardware is supposed to act in some specific way when it gets this sequence of bulk messages, but "sometimes" it does not, given that everytime I confirm that the message was actually sent by the driver using wireshark. I am trying to understand where the problem could be happening, so bare with me. Here I list my potential problems<br />
</p><p>1 - The hardware has a bug?<br />
2 - Due to my lack of understanding of how usbmon works, I list this as a potential problem: the hardware is not getting the bulk messages although they are listed in wireshark's capture. That means, that something between wireshark and the hardware is holding these bulk messages. Does this assumption hold grounds?<br />
3 - My driver is causing some corruption/overflow/illegal access in the Linux OS, which causes this deterministic behaviour? Does this assumption hold grounds?</p><p>I find it very hard to believe that 2 &amp; 3 may be occuring. Can someone agree or disagree with me on my potential problems and perhaps shed the light on something that I am not seeing?</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">driver usbmon linux</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>14 Aug '16, 04:38</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bc05331089e123840d72991e06961c61?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="dawood&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>dawood<br />

Upon probing, the driver does bulk writes requesting the device to perform some operations, and then the driver does bulk reads reading some info from the device. An example of the "working" transaction is in number 1427-1430 (Write, Success, Read, Success). An example of a "non-working" transaction is 1779-1784 (Write, Success, Read, -ENOENT).</p><p>Where do I see the "S"s and the "C"s? Are you referring to WireShark or some file in the kernel that I can look at?</p><p>Here is one more discovery: If I reset the usb connection by writing 0 then 1 to /sys/bus/usb/devices/bus-device/authorized file, everything goes back to normal until I unload and load the driver several times again.</p></div><div id="comment-54814-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(15 Aug '16, 05:14)</span> dawood</div></div><span id="54816"></span><div id="comment-54816" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-54816-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I am referring to Wireshark. In your file, e.g. in frame 1426, in the dissection pane, after clicking the <code>USB URB</code> tree open, you can see two lines marked here with <code>!!!!!!</code> because it is impossible to use bold in code:</p><p><code>USB URB     [Source: 3.4.2]     [Destination: host]     URB id: 0xffff8800a2c74000     URB type: URB_COMPLETE ('C')    !!!!!!

I assume it is correlated with the failure case, is it?</p><p>As you describe it I would assume the hardware to be nervous from getting the same bulk data again without a reset, but it is not more than an experienced speculation. Have you compared the bulk transfer payload extracted from the capture to be identical between the working and non-working case?</p></div><div id="comment-54816-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(15 Aug '16, 05:30)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="54818"></span><div id="comment-54818" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-54818-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks for the explanation. Yes, all 4 cases are correlated.</p><p>I have looked at the bulk transfer payload in both cases. In the non-working case, the data sometimes appears , while other times does not, and sometimes comes out of order. I cannot see any deterministic behaviour.</p><p>In my assumption number 2, is it valid to think that there may be a possiblility that the hardware is not getting the bulk write messages although they are listed in wireshark's capture? Is there a way where I can confirm that?</p><p>The device has a windows driver, and we have never seen such an issue, so I am inclined to think that there may be a chance that it is not a hardware bug.</p></div><div id="comment-54818-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(15 Aug '16, 05:42)</span> dawood</div></div><span id="54819"></span><div id="comment-54819" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-54819-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>In the non-working case, the data sometimes appears , while other times does not, and sometimes comes out of order.</p></blockquote><p>I'm afraid I may not have been clear enough, I had in mind to compare between the good and bad cases the data which your driver sends to the hardware.</p><p>If you got me that way and so you also talk about the <strong>sent</strong> data in the captured URBs to appear or not or to come in swapped order, it is an issue of the driver. <code>usbmon</code> shows you the URBs in the order the device driver has sent them to the host controller. If they are garbled already there, the device driver is to be blamed.</p><p>If you compare the responses of the device and they come garbled although the sent data were exactly the same as in the working case, you would need a hardware monitor of the USB bus (which is a box worth hundreds of $) to be able to see what has happened to the sent data between the host controller and the wire.</p></div><div id="comment-54819-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(15 Aug '16, 05:53)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="54820"></span><div id="comment-54820" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-54820-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I see what you mean.

They are even identical.</p><p>We also confirmed that the bulk messages sent by the driver are in order, but the usb payload that we read back from the hardware (or what appears to be coming back from hardware) either comes out of order, or does not come at all.</p><p>Ok, I see, maybe we can try to get our hands on a hardware monitor of the USB bus.

In the first case in the capture, you send GET DESCRIPTOR request, get the response, exchange a couple of bulk out and bulk in, and then use SET INTERFACE to alternate setting 0 which is the only one available. But then, you start from bulk_out, so maybe the internal context of the device is different and the device treats the same data in the bulk out in a different way, so a GET DESCRIPTOR is necessary to put the state machine in it to the correct state?</p></div><div id="comment-54821-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(15 Aug '16, 06:21)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="54822"></span><div id="comment-54822" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-54822-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Yes, that is a great idea.

Alternate setting 0, which is the default one at device startup, would be used for the exchange of bulk transfers in the initialisation phase, and alternate setting 1 would be used for the operation phase. Here, the philosophy seems to be that the init phase spawns from GET DESCRIPTOR to SET INTERFACE, and the operation phase is from SET INTERFACE onwards.</p><p>Are you reverse engineering the protocol from a Windows version?
