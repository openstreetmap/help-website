<p>Here in Berlin, we have several 'bus stops' (places with a bus stop sign) which are for the sole purpose of giving the drivers undisturbed time to rest. Such bus stops are always separate from those where passengers can embark or disembark. In fact, in order to pick up the first passengers, the bus has to be moved (sometimes only a few meters) to the next 'official' bus stop.</p>
<p>The bus stop signs are equal to the 'normal' bus stop signs but they are marked with the given special purpose. As bus stop sign along the road, I think they could/should be shown on the map, but they serve no purpose for pedestrian passengers and thus need to be marked specifically.</p>
<p>Q: Should these bus stops be marked? If yes, how?</p>
