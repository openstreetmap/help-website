<p>Virtually all, if not all, highways on the islands of Savai'i and Upolu in Samoa show up on KeepRight as <em>Floating Islands - This way is not connected to the rest of the map</em> - like this example <a href="http://keepright.ipax.at/report_map.php?schema=47&amp;error=54151365">http://keepright.ipax.at/report_map.php?schema=47&amp;error=54151365</a></p>
<p>Is this because Samoa is an island without mapped transport links to other parts of the world? Is there some basic tag missing from the islands? Larger islands such as New Zealand or the United Kingdom don't seem to suffer from this problem!</p>
<p>How can I or someone else correct this?</p>

<p>If they're false positives, and the problem doesn't occur elsewhere, I'd just mark them as such in keepright and not worry about it.</p>

<p>That seems to be the reason. However marking all these reports as false positives will be a lot of work, especially since there could be a few true positives among them. Of course you can just ignore all of them by unchecking "floating islands" on the left.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I've always found the maintainer of keepright extremely helpful when dealing with the (rare) issues that crop up on the site. You could perhaps mention it to them too; but personally I'm not sure that "unconnected roads on islands are identified as islands" is such a serious issue.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the suggestions. I've emailed KeepRight asking for comments. I mentioned that my main concern was that all the false positives could well obscure some genuine unconnected highways. I'll post their answer here in due course.<br />
Just trying to improve things where I can.</p>

<p>Here's the answer from Harald at KeepRight.......</p>
<p>"thank you very much for pointing me to that question!</p>
<p>in fact there is a list of starting points in the source code of the islands check, just about 140 locations from around the globe I picked randomly. The check successively finds ways connected to the ways already known and step by step tries to reach the whole planet. It includes ferries so the program may travel across the sea if the ferry is connected to the network of highways at a junction node.</p>
<p>Looks like as if there is no ferry to Sāmoa drawn in OSM. In this case I have to add a well known starting point to the check. The ferry line connecting the two islands is drawn correctly so only one new starting point should suffice. In a few days the error markers should disappear and make the islands check useful for Samoa"</p>
<p>I'll check when KeepRight is next run and see how things look. I'm really impressed by how everyone is keen to improve things and help solve any issues with OSM. Great teamwork!</p>

<p>Excellent! Harald's tweak to KeepRight or OSM has worked. There are still several 'unconnected ways' on both islands but these are likely genuine errors which merit some on the ground investigation by any mappers who might be visiting Samoa. At least they are now clearly identifiable and not obscured by 'noise'.</p>

<p>Yes, I guess the missing transport links (I guess only ferries / bridges) are the cause, although I do not know why it does not show up for New Zealand. Maybe NZ is entered as a new start point for the accessibility search in keepright, but doing so for every small island is likely too much work (also <a href="http://keepright.ipax.at/report_map.php?schema=47&amp;error=54151365&amp;zoom=14&amp;lat=57.81021&amp;lon=-8.57615&amp;layers=B0T&amp;ch=0%2C30%2C40%2C50%2C70%2C90%2C100%2C110%2C120%2C130%2C150%2C160%2C170%2C180%2C191%2C192%2C193%2C194%2C195%2C196%2C197%2C198%2C201%2C202%2C203%2C204%2C205%2C206%2C207%2C208%2C210%2C220%2C231%2C232%2C270%2C281%2C282%2C283%2C284%2C285%2C291%2C292%2C293%2C294%2C295%2C296%2C297%2C298%2C311%2C312%2C313%2C320%2C350%2C370%2C380%2C401%2C402%2C411%2C412%2C413&amp;show_ign=1&amp;show_tmpign=1">happens</a> near Scotland mainland). E.g. for Great Britain there are many many ferry connections mapped.</p>
<p>I would suggest to just switch off this check category when you want to use keepright on those islands.</p>

If there simply are no ferry connections (SK53), then, I would just switch off the warning category as I do not think that the keepright devs can make an exception for every small island. Maybe(!) it would be useful to map something like reachable_by_ferry=no / really_no_ferries_to_this_island=yes on the coastline or <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/3068059">https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/3068059</a> to help tools like keepright (could start a new accessibility analysis then)</p>
