<p>Hi</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to delete all my edits at once, rather than deleting assets one by one? for instance, if I wanted to delete all the edits I have done in one day, would I be able to do that?</p>
<p>I have made the mistake of uploading to OSM a load of bumps, but not all bumps have been reviewed and they have slipped in some how. My intention was only to load bumps within Enfield (which I had reviewed and attached to roads), and instead all other bumps got uploaded too.</p>
<p>Any help on this would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Many thanks Paula</p>

<p>As you're using JOSM the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/Reverter">reverter plugin</a> suggested in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/92907226#map=11/51.4950/-0.2565">this changeset discussion</a> is probably your best bet. I linked to the wiki page as it mentions you may have to revert conflicts (if you try and revert one of your changesets where some of the objects have been edited since).</p>
