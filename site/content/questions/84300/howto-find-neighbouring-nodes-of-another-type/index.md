<p>Hello, all,</p>
<p>Some searching didn't result in an answer to my question, hence this question of mine here ...</p>
<p>I'd like to get to know how I could find charging stations with a restaurant in their immediate vicinity (roughly 100m, just naming a number). I have this idea I'd extract all of the area's charging stations in one file, and all restaurants in another file. But then : how can I find out the nodes which are in each other's close vicinity ? Or would it maybe be better to import OSM into a database of mine, and make a select query ?</p>
