<p>Not much more to report: on Sunday evening Jan. 23rd I uploaded 2 .gpx files, produced by the same utility that produced successful files in the past. Got the usual information about the 30 minutes it might take to upload. Patiently waited 24 hours - no sign. Then uploaded again - still no sign.</p>
<p>Really frustrating to get no kind of error report - something must be wrong, but for all my effort I am not judged worth of knowing what. BAH!</p>

<p>For info, I don't think that there's anything wrong with your files. Other people have mentioned (on the mailing list) that uploads have been failing.</p>
<p>I've had files that have failed to upload but when I've retried the same file later it's worked, so I don't think that there is anything wrong with the files.</p>

<p>The real problem here is that the upload was never accepted - the message saying that it would be processed shortly was erroneous.</p>
<p>There were a couple of vague reports during the day on Monday but nothing concrete enough to allow me to pin the problem down. At 21:45 on Monday evening a proper bug reports was made in trac (<a href="http://trac.openstreetmap.org/ticket/3479">ticket #3479</a>) with full details of the problem and it was fixed within 45 minutes of that report.</p>
<p>There is still an outstanding issue that uploads via the web site fail to report errors properly (uploads via the API do) and I will be addressing that in due course.</p>

<p>If you have a GPX file that is consistently not uploading, please paste it somewhere so we can look at it. It's hard to diagnose your problem without knowing exactly what you're trying to do.</p>
<p>Please also try and remain calm - conspiracy theories about "I am not judged worthy", little snipes about "even Microsoft do that", and angry diary posts really don't encourage people to help solve your problem. We're all volunteers, you know.</p>

<p>Richard, as a professional IT-er I do know how hard life can be. It is frustrating enough to see the work not working, but I am quite used to that and often even enjoy working it out. What made me shout is the total lack of diagnostics or error messages. My crying had already been detected by another volunteer and I'll be mailing my files to him shortly. I will however insist that they be used first and foremost as a debugging example to create useful feedback for the other volunteers, if their precious work cannot be uploaded. And I'll be happy to serve as a test victim, receiving and validating the error feedback as it (hopefully) is implemented. Lack of information is really the worst one can suffer from an Information Technology system (bar "loss of information", of course...). To see my own poor files uploaded will of course be nice, but it is not the first priority. The first goal should be to improve communications with uploaders. That said, my sincere gratitude for your patience and efforts - keep up the good work. Kind regards,</p>
