<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I'm currently working on a project and for that, I need to create a list of all streets with respective names for a set of European countries. In my efforts of doing so, I used QGIS and the OSM tool, but in doing so I was running into the problem of double countings. I was wondering whether I could download the data directly from OSM for each respective country, to avoind the issues I was running into prior.</p>
<p>I'm very new to this and have no experince in SQL but I'm willing to learn and would appriciate any suggestion you might have.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
