<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am currently working on a Salesforce project where we use OpenStreetMap on a Lightning Web Component. We make a callout to another system with some parameters for filtering and we receive a list of coordinates to paint polygons on the map to delimite geofences on cities. We have this component in both a development and production organization. In development org it works perfectly, but in the production org, where the component code is exactly the same, we also receive correctly the coordinates (is not a request problem), but the polygon sometimes appears and when you zoom it it suddenly cut off, or sometimes it doesn't even paint the polygon at all.</p>
<p>We have tried to load the coordinates of a city of the production org on the development org to check if it was a data matter, but it loaded perfectly with no cutting when zooming.</p>
<p>It is curious because it doesn't always cut the polygon at the same point, it depends where you zoom from. I attach some images to show it:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/9NDo1OL">Image polygon appears correctly with no zoom</a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/LDQQ5wo">Image polygon appears correctly with some zoom</a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/EEOA3Ig">Image polygon cuts off</a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/MTFQEjQ">Image polygon cuts off at different point</a></p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help you can give me.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
