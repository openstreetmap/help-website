<p>Hello, im working on a project that involves crossing terrestrial borders.</p>
<p>Depending on the tools i use, routes generated are very different (itinerary programs/websites) For example, it seems that borders that are actually closed because of new or ongoing wars, are still accessible using openstreetmap, which can be problematic for a traveller, although we better check recommandations before travelling.</p>
<p>Other borders, like the border between Morocco and Algeria is closed, so the route that is given by openstreetmap makes you go from Morocco to Spain, and from Spain to Algeria, which even if it is very absurd, make sense with the political relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Can you tell me, what is the parameter set to define a closed border, and eventually if i can get a listing of all the country borders that are set with this parameter, that compute the results.</p>
<p><em>if i sum up</em>, is it possible to compute something like : border_type : nation. boundary : administrative. get all borders that have the outer relation for each other?</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help</p>
