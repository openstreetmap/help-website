<p>Hi, you have successfully removed the abusive words. It takes a while for all zoom levels to be re-rendered but the change will take effect at all zoom levels. It seems that in editing you have deleted and redrawn the building as well. Thus all history that may have been contained in the different versions of the data pertaining to the building is now lost. When editing such situations it is better to amend the existing building outline and tagging so that all history is maintained. Then I would have been able to see from the history who did what and when. I would then have been able to look at other edits by the contributor who made the abusive edits and see if there was more abuse.</p>
<p>Your editing is OK though.</p>
