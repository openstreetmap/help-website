<p>I don't think there is a hard rule, but I tend to <em>prefer</em> having the roundabout as a single looped way.</p>
<p>I'd rather keep the roundabout whole if possible. It makes it easier to move it around or form it into a circle. It also seems less likely to confuse mapping/routing apps, which may treat multiple ways tagged roundabout as multiple roundabouts.</p>
<p>I don't think it is a problem if a bus route is shown to go all the way around the roundabout rather than just between the entrance and exit, especially if it is a fairly small roundabout. And bear in mind that if the bus makes the return route in the opposite direction then it will use all of the roundabout anyway.</p>
<p>Having said that, I wouldn't go and <em>fix</em> this if I saw other OSMers had mapped it as separate ways.</p>

<p>I think I'm the same. I think better to keep it as a single looped way, but I'm unlikely to go and change this if someone did it the other way.</p>
<p>I did wonder if this question is related to the relation checker, as it thinks the route might have a break in it if it goes through a roundabout. Even so, for the same reasons as above, I'd tend to keep it as a single looped way.</p>

<p><span>@Ebenezer</span> more of a general question really. I can see reasons for doing it both ways, but I'm tending to favour option B) right now despite having done A) in the past myself (not a reason to go back and "fix" of course).</p>
<p>One of the important factors is maintainability. Relations are fairly tricky at the best of times, and a heavily split-up roundabout with diverging feeder oneways and crossing routes can be a pig to maintain if people are adding purely geometric splits and changes for other reasons. Making the data less fragile, or less liable to be broken by editors is a Good Thing™</p>

<p>Software treating multiple ways tagged as roundabouts, as multiple roundabouts, is in error; roundabouts can be, for example, partially on a bridge=* - i.e. one main road passes under the roundabout. And lane counts can change within the roundabout. One way: good start - many ways: more detail.</p>

<p>As <span>@alv</span> pointed out, there are many more reasons to split the roundabout way. Any routing application should be able to use split roundabout added correctly to relation.<br />
The bus does not always go the same road back and it obviously does not circle around, which makes it incorrect. Of course still better one way than nothing.</p>

<p>It is better to split the way of the roundabout to better reflect reality. Roundabouts are one way streets, and a bus route even goes on different streets depending on the direction.</p>
<p>Sooner or later the roundabout will be split into parts anyways, because other attributes (lit, lanes, maxheight, enforcement, restrictions, etc.) are different, too.</p>
<p>Do not map for other persons comfort. Map reality.</p>
