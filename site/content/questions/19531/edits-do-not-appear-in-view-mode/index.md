<p>Your changes look OK - they're just taking a little while to render on the main map. There's a bit more about the process in the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/FAQ#I_have_just_made_some_changes_to_the_map._How_do_I_get_to_see_my_changes.3F">FAQ</a>, and there's more of the technical detail (including how to cheat to get things to render quicker) in <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/178/how-often-does-the-main-mapnik-map-get-updated">this help question</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your responses. Looks like the updates took place. It just takes a while. I will look at the help links you provided to speed things up a little. One issue I saw was that at zoom level 3 (assuming 1 to be full mag.), my edits never made it into that layer. That was the layer I was looking at all along.</p>
<p>The editor plugin stopped working for me in Chrome after I installed an update from HP to fix a scanner problem (using kUbuntu 12.10). Purged cache, restarted browser, machine, nothing would revive it. I switched to Firefox and things came back to normal. Still, the 3rd layer does not appear to be updated in Firefox as well as in Chrome. This is probably another timing thing or is it?</p>
<p>I guess I'm good to go. I noticed that the boundaries of a neighboring park aren't quite right and that some walking pathes aren't mapped in yet. I will return and make the changes later.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
