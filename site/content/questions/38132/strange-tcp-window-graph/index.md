I should have used the term volitial TCP window rather than shrinking.The issue is the same no matter what end devices I test between that are on different sides of our wan link, Test from A to B run at 100mbs while test B to A run at ~10mbs. So this is a WAN link issue not device/application issue.</p></div><div id="comment-38528-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(11 Dec '14, 05:20)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">DevilWAH</span></div></div><span id="38537"></span><div id="comment-38537" class="comment"><div id="post-38537-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Well, shrinking window-size is an indication that data arrives faster at the receiving TCP than the reading application is consuming it. The fact the tcp receive buffer is just 32K in your scenario does not leave much room for a continuous flow and it will certainly come to a (close to) Window-Full condition.</p><p>(frame.time_delta gt 0.02 and ip.src == 183.217.185.133) or tcp.analysis.window_full</p><p>The out of order arrivals are not due to packet loss as the missing packets are following suit within the same instant and the ip.id suggests the were leaving the sending side 'in order' and are NOT retransmissions. So as there is not much network between the communicating partners the are out of order when they left the sending 6500 router. This might be due to EtherChannel protocol</p></div><div id="comment-38537-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(11 Dec '14, 22:04)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">mrEEde</span></div></div><span id="38565"></span><div id="comment-38565" class="comment"><div id="post-38565-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Hi,</p><p>thank you for that explanation, Just one thing, the packets are being sent from the 3845 side of the link which is a router so I can see any reason that it would be a Ether-channel issue. The 3845 seems to think it is sending the packets in order. the queuing is set to FIFO and a "embedded Packet capture" on the 3845 on the outgoing interface shows all the packets are in order. This then passes in to the NTE of our ISP, thorough vodafone and BT network and then back out to our 6506. Vodafone have told me that half way through the link they are seeing the out of order packets. SO it seems the first leg of the trip is where the issues is happening.</p></div><div id="comment-38565-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(15 Dec '14, 03:21)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">DevilWAH</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-38507" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-38507-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
