<p>I am using OSM to plot locations on a map in another database, a very small percentage of the businesses I am plotting are not converting to the database. I have tried every which way of adding them to the map, adding tags that match the address exactly. And I just ran the report for the map and again, none of them show up. Any ideas how I can get these addresses to work or why they wouldn't be converting? They come up if I search in the OSM search engine just not in my database.</p>

<p>Yes - I am using iDashboards datahub. It is pulling data from a site that we store all of our contacts information (addresses). It's then converting the addresses through OSM into latitude/longitude to plot the contacts onto a map. Out of 1,000 contacts, we first had 50 that wouldn't convert to lat/lon, I figured out that updating the address to exactly what OSM wants to read worked. Then there were about 30 that didn't work, so I manually plotted them into OSM, now there are about 5-10 that I've manually plotted that just won't convert to lat/lon in the iDashboard data hub. I am not experienced in mapping whatsoever but have taken on this project. I can't figure out what else I can try to hopefully get the lat/lon to work.</p>

<p>That sounds like if the service you are using simply is lagging behind OSM with updating. You should ask the provider how frequently they update.</p>
