<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am new to Umap and would like to use it for an analogical example as :</p>
<p>Record owners who have cats and/or dogs, then have the following views/filters :</p>
<ul>
<li>see owners who have only cats</li>
<li>see owners who have only dogs</li>
<li>see owners who have cats and dogs</li>
</ul>
<p>I created points with new properties "number of cats" and "number of dogs" with associated information about the owner with his name and address. All this on the same layer.</p>
<p>How can I filter by cats/dogs to have the above three views ?</p>
<p>A workaround would be to create the same points with information of the owner on two different layers. One layer for cats and the other for dogs. But this forces to have a redundancy in owner's information (with complicated maintenance...etc)</p>
<p>Is there a better way to make it ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
