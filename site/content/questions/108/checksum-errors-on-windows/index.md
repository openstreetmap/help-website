Normaly I would agree to Bill that if you've done the trace on the host itself, it might that the OS/Driver uses a feature which is called checksum offloading. If you've done the trace on a mirror or span port of a switch, than I agree, you shouldn't see the checksum errors. In regards to the Ip address you've mentioned it looks that you use private IPs which are natted on the router to your provider. It's quit normal that you also get traffic back, espacially if you use TCP as mentioned. So you'll see also packets flowing in your direction, so your IP is the destination. If I got something wrong, upload a trace and I can have a look to it.

The problem what I was thinking about is, that the OS is preparing the outgoing packet/frame. But it leaves the computing intensive thing (calculating the checksum) for the NIC. This is called checksum offloading. Since Wireshark can't capture the packet anymore while it is already pushed to the NIC you have most likely a wrong checksum (random memory values). To verify if you really have a problem, start a trace surf to a page, e.g. www.google.com, than stop the trace. If you see than in the Wireshark main window persistant restransmissions, you may have a problem with your NIC/Driver or your connection to the Internet is bad. If you don't see retransmissions, your NIC does checksum offloading. On some cards you can disable this is under the driver settings, if you really want to get rid of the errors which are most likely no errors. If you can't analyse the trace, upload it somewhere and I'll have a look.</p><p>regards Oliver</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>15 Sep '10, 15:35</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ea89a7136cee2bff4cc1ddbaf5e1b676?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Oliver&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>Oliver</span><br />

I had thought of placing a switch in line at various points and redirecting the data but didnt have the hardware. So, by the process of elimination, I know my computer is the source of the problem and I think it starts at level three or level four. I uninstalled IPv6, I disabled the IP helper service and also disabled the DHCP Broadcast Flag. I also disabled, uninstalled and downloaded latest driver for the nic but since it works with XP, I know the nic and driver are good. I did question the large send offload in the nic properties. It is enabled for IPv4 and version 2 is enabled for IPv6. I’m a resistor and capacitor kind of guy and although I have programmed processors in hex with some pascal/fortran/C on the side. I'm at a loss here with limited real world and seeing network signals. Sync and acknowledge is about the extent of my experience. All your help is greatly appreciated.

I first went to the device manager, nic card properties, and then the advanced settings. There I turned the offloading off for IPv4 and IPv6. WireShark didn’t like when I turned off IPv4 offloading and shut down but I just restarted WireShark and all was good. Once WireShark was up again, I saw the exact same problem with no change what so ever. At that point, I turned both of those back on. I was streaming music at this point. Next, I did exactly what you said. I first shut down all windows and let the system settle down. After a couple of minutes, I started WireShark and observed the system until I was sure it was stable with no errors also it had no errors at this point. Then I opened IEv8 in Win7 and went to my homepage (yahoo.com) and the errors started just as usual. Then very quickly, I closed IE (yahoo.com) and the errors stopped within a couple of seconds. I then reopened IE to yahoo.com and instantly the checksum errors started in the outbound lane. Then again, I shut IE down and the errors stopped in wireshark. I think that’s what you asked me to do and I guess the results confirm your suspicion. Is that correct? And if so, does that mean that I do not have a problem?
