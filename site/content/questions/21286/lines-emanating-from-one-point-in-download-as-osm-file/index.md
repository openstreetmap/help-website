<p>Dear OSM</p>
<p>There seems to be some problem with downloading .OSM files. I have tried with various areas. The roads and other line features get distorted, in that from one arbitrary point various straight lines emanate and this happens with all downloads as OSM file.</p>
<p>I have attached a screen shot of Cocos (Keeling) Island. You will see many roads emanating from one point, though such road alignment does not exist. I use Google Crome, I also tried with Internet Explorer, but same result.</p>
<p>I tried uploading the file but some karma&gt;60 error comes up, which I do not know how to resolve.</p>
<p>Thanks Anu</p>
