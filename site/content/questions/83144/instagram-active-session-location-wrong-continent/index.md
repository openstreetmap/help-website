<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I decided to randomly check my Instagram login activity because I'm pretty security conscious. I went onto recent Settings --&gt; Login Activity to find that my current active session (my phone that I am using) was located in Nepal... I live in Malta which is in Europe</p>
<p>I received 0 emails regarding new logins from anywhere but where I live. Once I removed access to the current active session (i.e my phone which is apparently in Nepal), it logged me out of my Instagram account on my phone.</p>
<p>Once I logged back in, it said the correct location, and it still does.</p>
<p>I compared the device ID logged in during that active session with my other devices and it was the same. Unfortunately I don't have a screenshot.</p>
<p>I checked all of my security check emails received to see that I never received anything. I once changed my ROM to a custom ROM however, the device ID remained the same, before, during, and after returning back to stock MIUI.</p>
<p>Is this any cause for concern, from the looks of it, I haven't been hacked as I wouldn't have received an email notification regarding a new device trying to gain access. Has anyone experienced something similar? I appreciate any help!</p>
<p>Note: I don't use any form of VPN</p>
