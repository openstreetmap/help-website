When I point my browser to the external entity, I see all those packets. However, when I telnet to the external device, I never see the telnet packets. Telnet works and I get to the host just fine. I just don't see them in Wireshark.</p><p>I have no capture or display filters in place... At all. I've done a complete uninstall of Wireshark (including settings) and reinstalled. For some reason my system is either dropping these or filtering them somewhere I can't find. Coworker's laptop with Wireshark sees the packets just fine. Thoughts? What the heck is going on with my system / install?</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">telnet</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>18 Jul '14, 12:11</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/92a30007136793701e4b9e809bbcf74d?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="AndyB&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>AndyB<br />
