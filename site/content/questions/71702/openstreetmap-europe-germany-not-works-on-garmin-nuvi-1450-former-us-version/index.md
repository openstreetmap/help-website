<p>Well, I bought a used Nüvi 1450 for my motorcycle, because I had build some special holder system which I liked to use also in future. Likely I did not see, that the Navi was a US-Version. At the beginning I did not take much attention to ist, because I liked to use OpenStreetMap as on the older Navi. (The old navi started to reboot when having to work hard, even after I exchanged the battery).</p>
<p>Because I cannot upload pictures, I will try to explain what happened.</p>
<p>When booting, Garmin shows "nüvi 1450 Copyright 2015 Garmin Ltd. or its subsidiaries" Second frame shows: "Garmin C OPENSTREETMAP.ORG CONTRIBUTORS. SEE: HTTP...." A remark pops up: "FM Traffic provider database missing. Go to www.garmin.com/webupdater to download it" In the --&gt;toolbox --&gt;Maps --&gt; Info I find "Open Street Map" [1] Germany</p>
<p>But when clicking on the map, I only see the vehicle, no map.</p>
<p>I have installed the map on a 32 Gbyte card and in folder Garmin.</p>
<p>I fear, the problem has something to do with the BaseMap of Garmin. But I do not know how to install a European / Atlantic Basemap.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help. Best regards from Germany.</p>

<p>Does the map you had on the old device work on the new one device? I am not sure, as the old one is not at hand right now. There are so many different pages about OSM that it is difficult to orientate. So I will try now another source and donwload.</p>

<p>OK Sorry people! I got the idea, that the last owner may be had been on a place outside of Europe. Because I had only one Satellite available, I was thinking, may be the Navi keeps the last coordinate until a new connection to Satellites was possible. Which would lead to an empty Map Screen, if the last owner was outside Europe before selling it to me.</p>
<p>And sorry, yes, that was the solution. I brought the Navi to a place where it could receive 3 Satellites and buuum, there is the map now.</p>
<p>Hope you did not spent too much time because of my stupidity ;-) Best regards from Germany.</p>

<p>From what I see <a href="https://forums.garmin.com/apps-software/mac-windows-software/f/garmin-express-windows/100349/garmin-expresse-nor-webupdater-recognise-device">here</a> and <a href="https://www.fixya.com/support/t12812710-fm_traffic_provider_database_missing">here</a> it does not look too good. Your device malfunctioned and files got erased. In the second link the person talked to Garmin and they would send a replacement unit.</p>
<p>Please search for "FM Traffic provider database missing." there are plenty of people with that error. I haven't looked through all posts. Maybe there are solutions.</p>

<p>OK. First map was from computerteddy so I have chosen an alternativ source: <a href="http://www.frikart.no/garmin/velgkart.html">http://www.frikart.no/garmin/velgkart.html</a> But also with the new map, no change. The map is mentioned under INFO but no signs of the map shown when clicking on "map".</p>
<p>The following data are on the Navi: (the ending .bak: I changed name in order to check if the data is involved in hindering the map to being displayed)</p>
<p>GUPDATE.GCD.bak gmapth.img.bak TrafficProvider.xml.bak (I wanted to be sure, that TrafficProvider US does not interfere with German map) 681709271.gma gmapprom.gma .express Gmapprom.unl fs_image.ver FOLDER: DDB Diag EULA ExtData.bak JCV Logs Remote SW sqlite sqlite.bak</p>
<p>On the micro-sd-Card one find: FOLDER .System (I copied the .system from the Navi) GARMIN (here I copied the map, named gmapsupp.img) D165900 (Garmin express did this when I tried to install languages. The folder contains: D165900.ver and Folder Text with languages</p>

<p>Is the Nuvi in Navigation mode and does it have a gps fix? and not simulated. Are you located in Germany in an area covered by the map? Otherwise a fix will show a blank map, but you proabley know that, I only say that i once downloaded a Australian.img and i took me a time to realise i had to locate a point on to map to see anything.</p>
