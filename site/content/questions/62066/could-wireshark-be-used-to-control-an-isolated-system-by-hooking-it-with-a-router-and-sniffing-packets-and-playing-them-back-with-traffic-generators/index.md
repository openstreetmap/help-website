To investigate any further, you'd need to make your own cable anyway, so the next step should be to find out its "pinout" in order to be able to replicate it. And using the replicated cable, on which you can connect measurement devices to individual wires, you'll need to use an oscilloscope to identify the levels, speeds etc. of the signals to be able to reverse-engineer deeper.</p><p>Overall your idea seems to be plausible as <a href="https://ask.wireshark.org/users/4/jaap">@Jaap</a> suggests. If the connection is an RS-232 (or RS-422, or some other serial communication), the decision to take would be wherher to use a "serial over IP" approach, allowing you to connect the original minitouch to the machine itself using a pair of serial over IP adaptor boxes, or whether to use a PC application to emulate the minitouch. The PC may be co-located and use direct RS-232 connection, or it may be your notebook using a "remote serial port" over IP (i.e. you'd use a single serial over IP box instead of two).</p></div><div id="comment-62084-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(17 Jun '17, 13:05)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="62093"></span><div id="comment-62093" class="comment"><div id="post-62093-score" class="comment-score">1</div><div class="comment-text"><p>Better drop the images at <a href="http://imgur.com">http://imgur.com</a> and posts links to there.</p></div><div id="comment-62093-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(18 Jun '17, 01:59)</span> Jaap ♦</div></div><span id="62094"></span><div id="comment-62094" class="comment"><div id="post-62094-score" class="comment-score">1</div><div class="comment-text"><p>Placing my comment here as your "answer" will be converted into a comment sooner or later.</p><p>As you have a manual for the minitouch panel which clearly says the panel's interface is a serial (RS-232/RS-422) one, forget about the oscilloscope etc., as the direction is clear: if you want to "insert internet" between the machine and the minitouch, serial over IP is your only option.</p><p>Now</p><ul><li><p>if it is enough for you to carry around the minitouch, it is not a Wireshark question any more, and it becomes a VPN question instead (how to provide access to the production machine over internet yet only for yourself and not for every wanna-be-hacker kiddie around the net).</p></li><li><p>if you would like to <em>replace</em> the minitouch, you can use Wireshark to capture the telnet session between the two Serial over IP boxes and find out how the minitouch communicates with the machine so that you could emulate the behaviour of the minitouch using a PC application (which I'm afraid doesn't exist and you'd have to write one yourself or ask someone to write it for you).

You may use Wireshark but only if you want to replace the minitouch by something else, and you need ready-made serial over IP adaptors or serial over IP software on general-purpose PCs to "translate" the serial communication into something that Wireshark can analyse - namely, a telnet session between the two serial over IP ends. To directly analyse the serial (RS-232, RS-422) communication, you'd need other software than Wireshark.</p><p>In any case, getting back to your initial idea, replacing the minitouch by a packet replay software only makes sense if no feedback from the PLC to the minitouch is expected so you can afford to just send pre-recorded commands without checking for previous ones' results.</p></div><div id="comment-62106-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(18 Jun '17, 11:51)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="62107"></span><div id="comment-62107" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-62107-score" class="comment-score">1</div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><blockquote><p>So now we know its a RS-232 DB25 PIN MALE, should I just forget about wireShark?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Yes.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>what would be best option of all we have so far?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>What, exactly, are you trying to do? You mention 'connect to internet' which you almost certainly don't want to do, at least not directly - unless you want some one else to be controlling your process for you! The security implications should frighten you.</p><p>If we know more about what you need to accomplish, we might have more ideas. I see this PLC has a second RS232 port, so that gives options for connecting to maybe a SCADA system which might provide the added functionality you need, or even a serial-to-Ethermet type adapter (say from Black Box, or many other vendors). A block diagram I saw says serial does ModbusRTU and that is very widely supported in the controls community.</p><p>A brief look at that platform and there is an Ethernet module, EH-ETH, that could be plugged into the backplane for Ethernet connectivity. The only docs I found for this module seem to indicate it is a custom Ethernet protocol which is unfortunate. A standard protocol would be much easier to integrate upstream.</p><p>The key, though, are the requirements. Do you need to capture data and send to a back-end database? Control this process from a central control room? Check on the operational status from another country?</p><p>Since this is really an automation/controls question, you might have better luck over at <a href="http://www.plcs.net">http://www.plcs.net</a>.</p></div><div id="comment-62107-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(18 Jun '17, 12:00)</span> Bob Jones</div></div><span id="62112"></span><div id="comment-62112" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-62112-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>thanks a lot Bob Jones for joining, appreciate your help. Thank you too sindy, your answer was hidden so I just saw it, [[ What, exactly, are you trying to do? ]]</p><p>My final goal is to store the information in a database. In picture 6 you can see one of the two screens that provides information, the navigation between the two screens is by pressing those arrows in bottom corners and then select the two available screens, I don't have the picture of the other screen (let's call it screen2) but it has 4 outputs. In Screen1 (picture 6) there is only two outputs "ASPIRADOR 1" and "ASPIRADOR 2", the screen shows only the totals but does not log the moment when the counter goes up, you can see the number increase if you are looking at the screen but there are no logs with attached time so....</p><p>what I need every time any counter goes up, is to annotate the actual time with the actual amount in each counter and to store it into a data base.</p><p>I don't need to control the machine itself, only to retrieve its data. Well.... maybe need to send signals to change between screen 1 and 2 but don't know if it's really necessary to back and forth between the two screens because maybe all this counter data travels in the same array of data and in that case I would not be needing to send any kind of input but only to intercept any bytes that tells me the 6 numbers I need coming from the 6 counters, the program that writes to the data base would only need to know when that array of data has change to add a new registry and the actual time of comparison, don't know if it's going to be that easy.</p><p>I see the problem you both mention about security and I see my vague explanations about "connecting to internet", I really don't care how many middle step workarounds until I get to have that data accessible from my home computer, before I found this forum I was considering crazy stuff like my plan B was to point an IP camera focusing the screen, a some automated finger pushing the screen changing between 1 and 2 continuously, and in the other client side where the output of the camera would be an image-to-text soft like abby screen reader to read the numbers and with a macro program paste that to a local database.... but after reading your answers I see I was going completely in the wrong direction so could you please tell me what is best option based the only requirements of retrieving 6 counter numbers (two counters in screen 1 and four counters in screen 2)?</p></div><div id="comment-62112-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(18 Jun '17, 20:51)</span> verzulsan</div></div><span id="62128"></span><div id="comment-62128" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-62128-score" class="comment-score">1</div><div class="comment-text"><p>What is your background and budget? If you understand the PLC protocols and you can invest into the Ethernet module, I'd definitely take the way recommended by <a href="https://ask.wireshark.org/users/112/bob-jones">@Bob Jones</a>.</p><p>If your budget is tight but you have plenty of spare time to spend on it and have some programming skills, then you may continue this home-made way. I'm not a master of PLC sports myself, but one thing you surely <strong>must not</strong> do is to attempt to send commands from the minitouch and your DIY setup in parallel over the same port on the PLC, as this would be a fast track to hell. So to reverse engineer the communication between the minitouch and the PLC itself, your best bet is to insert two serial over IP adaptors talking TCP (telnet) to each other via a traffic mirroring switch (Mikrotik RB260GS or Netgear GS105E<strong>v2</strong> are low-cost candidates which can deal with the task), and connect your PC to a monitoring port and use Wireshark to see what they talk about. If you can spot the values you are interested in to be sent periodically (which I seriously doubt), you have almost won as it is enough to create an application running on a PC which will connect over packet network to one of the serial over IPs whose receiving input will be connected in parallel to the receiving direction of the minitouch and whose transmitting output will not be connected anywhere. This way, you would wiretap the ongoing transmission and update the value on your web page visualizing it.</p><p>If, however, the PLC only provides the values if asked to do so by a keypress on the minitouch, I would recommend to try to connect the minitouch to the other serial port of the PLC first, and if it works there, to try to connect two simultaneously, each one to one of the ports, and use one to ask for the values while using the other for something else. If the PLC can deal with this, you have almost won too because the difference as compared to the previous possibility is that you'll need to send the "show me this variable" requests.</p><p>Or exclude the serial over IP stuff and use a PC with two serial ports (USB to 232 adaptors should be enough) to record the RS232 traffic, using only receiving inputs of these ports, one connected in parallel to each direction, but in such case it is not a Wireshark question any more ;-)</p></div><div id="comment-62128-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(19 Jun '17, 09:44)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="62151"></span><div id="comment-62151" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-62151-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Thank you</p><p>I have read many times all of your posts specially the last two ones of sindy and Bob Jones and it was a difficult decision because I was enjoying the idea of getting it all done with wireshark but even though I was enjoying learning wireShark, looking into serial over IP, boxes, Ethernet connectivity, etc, it all looks to me way more complicated and expensive and time consuming than the PC with two serial ports to record the RS232 traffic, but as you both said that is not a wireShark question, so I'll try that option to see where and how it ends, I'll try also in the suggested page <a href="http://www.plcs.net">http://www.plcs.net</a>.</p><p>Thanks a million for all the help, really!, you have all saved me lot of time and effort, I have tried to thumbs up all of you but I have not enough points yet so as soon as I have them I'll come back and give them to you (I don't know how to thank you), lot of more information I was expecting to get.

Or maybe could be done no matter the cable type?.</p><p>"PC application to emulate the mini touch" would be great idea, I didn't think that could exist, I haven't find anything about it yet but it is a really interesting idea that I want to google more.</p><p>I got a little lost about the explanation of using pair of serial over IP adaptor boxes and the example of using a single serial over IP box instead of two</p><p>-</p><p>Thanks a lot again Jaap and sindy for all your help,</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p><strong>PICTURE 1</strong> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/YLg1kgQ.png" alt="alt text" /></p><p><strong>PICTURE 2</strong> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Uuq1maG.png" alt="alt text" /></p><p><strong>PICTURE 3</strong> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/efXCnLu.png" alt="alt text" /></p><p><strong>PICTURE 4</strong> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/7Dm8knn.png" alt="alt text" /></p><p><strong>PICTURE 5</strong> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/AsF3Vrp.png" alt="alt text" /></p><p><strong>PICTURE 6</strong> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/K4bQ2jU.png" alt="alt text" /></p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>18 Jun '17, 00:59</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e8466e14d056522599fd9f729ae2899c?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="verzulsan&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>verzulsan<br />
