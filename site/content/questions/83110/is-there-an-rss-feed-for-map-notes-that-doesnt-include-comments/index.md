<p>However, the rss feed of open notes also includes "new comments" an "closed note". Is there a way to to get an rss feed that only includes notes and not comments?</p>
<p>This would be very handy for me to help keep up with notes in a specific area without being overwhelmed by comments.</p>

<p>I've stumbled about the same problem in the past. It says "new note" in the title but in fact only is a new comment. Sometimes you even receive "new note" feeds of old notes without any apparent change.</p>
<p>I don't know of any way to work around this. You can try to leave a feature request on <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website">Github</a> to change that in the future. A simple fix would be to have different titles for the messages so one could properly filter in omne's reader.</p>
