</p><p>If your WiFi network is using WPA2 (which I hope it is!), then you will need to decrypt the WiFi traffic. This requires capturing the EAP exchange at the beginning of the WiFi connection between the Nest and your WiFi network. This will require you to go to the WiFi settings in the Nest, delete the WiFi profile that has already been established (assuming that one is established), start the WiFi capturing and then reconnect the Nest to the WiFi network. This is not a big deal.</p><p>However, all traffic (yes, even simple ON/OFF commands) are sent to the Nest server over HTTPS. This means that all Internet traffic is encrypted using TLS/SSL. But there is a way around this also. You will need to set-up a proxy server and capture the HTTPS - basically emulating a man-in-the-middle attack.</p><p>Still interested? ;)</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>20 Jul '15, 17:52</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d9cf592a79eafbc3b2a8b3f38cf38362?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Amato_C&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Amato_C<br />
