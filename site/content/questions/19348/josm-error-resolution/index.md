<p>I'm new to JOSM and after making a few minor edits, e.g., adding Thai street names, was confronted with some error messages when attempting to upload my changes. Some were warnings, something to the effect that several of the ways had very similar names (which is true but correct), but one was warning about a single-node highway.</p>
<p>I eventually figured it out but the finding those errors in the map was tricky. I can't seem to locate any material explaining JOSM's error handling or how to go about conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Can anyone point me to some tutorials or other material?</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this answers your question, but if you open the 'validation results' window, you can then right-click on any of the warnings in the box at the right of screen and choose 'zoom to problem'. Saves having to trawl through all your work to find the apparent error.</p>

<p>I stumbled on that solution myself. It was how I eventually found the error. But I can find no mention of how to do it in the JOSM Help or in its Wiki nor any other mention of resolving errors.</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer.</p>
