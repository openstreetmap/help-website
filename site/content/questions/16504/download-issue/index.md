I am unable to download drivers from Dell's support site. The download starts, I get about 300k of data, and then the time remaining just increments until I get a network error.</p><p>I've tried it with IE, Firefox, and Chrome. All do the same thing. I've tried it on different PC's within our network, same thing. I've checked with Dell, works fine on their end. I've looked at my firewall configuration and logs (Watchguard), nothing posted except the "allow" when I connect to Dell. I ran Wireshark during a test download and filtered out everything but packets from/to the IP address of my PC.</p><p>In Wireshark I can see Dell sending packets and my PC acking them for a few seconds. Then it stops with my PC sending 3 or 4 acks. Then I see a ton of DNS related entries between my PC and our DNS (hosted) most say "no such name" and then a bunch of entries from and to "deploy.akamaitechnology.com". During all this DNS/akama stuff I see Dell acking but no response from my PC. Eventually I get the network error message.</p><p>Does anyone have any thoughts on this? I'm a newby to Wireshark and I don't understand all the different entries I'm seeing and they could be normal. Looking for any pointers to anything that might help me resolve this issue. Thanks.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">download dns error</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>03 Dec '12, 09:11</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/03bcc04666f32465e6983969e0ed2a74?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="xlcfdp&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>xlcfdp<br />

We will see, if that's enough information to analyze the problem. Regarding your internal IP addresses, you can use a pcap file anonymizer.</p><blockquote><p><code>http://ask.wireshark.org/questions/16367/capture-file-anonymization</code></p></blockquote></div><div id="comment-16713-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(07 Dec '12, 14:10)</span> Kurt Knochner ♦</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-16504" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 6 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 1 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-16504-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
