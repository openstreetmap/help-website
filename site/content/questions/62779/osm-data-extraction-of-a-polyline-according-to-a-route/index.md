<p>Hi everybody, I would need to extract the only polyline, union of many ways, with the tag data that represents a route, already decided by me (example a gpx), so not a pre-existing relation! This then goes on to carry out analyzes on road data, also using GIS methods. I have difficulties. I have seen that there are routing services that are based on OSM, such as <a href="https://maps.openrouteservice.org">https://maps.openrouteservice.org</a> or <a href="https://www.komoot.com">https://www.komoot.com</a> and other, which offer a service of the highway analysis, but do not allow to download the data in raw format .osm. The problem is not simple. I also thought about using OverpassTurbo, but I do not think is the right way. I could also use GIS methods with QGIS. If someone has already addressed the topic and can give me suggestions</p>
