If you right-click a packet and select "Manually Resolve Address", it brings up a dialog box which allows you to manually type in a name for the selected IP. However, it appears you have to also select the "Enable network name resolution" checkbox. Once you do this, Wireshark seems to correctly use the arbitrary label you supply, but it also appears to try and resolve everything else in DNS. I guess if you want to use arbitrary labels for hosts, you need to label each one or else Wireshark will use DNS.</p><p>I like the intent of this feature, but it seems a bit clunky. I'd like to simply select an arbitrary IP address and give it a label, without being forced to resolve everything else in DNS. It seems like those two features could be separated further.</p></div><div id="comment-23826-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 Aug '13, 10:48)</span> smp</div></div><span id="23830"></span><div id="comment-23830" class="comment"><div id="post-23830-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Agreed. Manually resolving a single IP address ought to work without having to turn on full network name resolution.
