<p>I want to develop a hiking application as part of a university project in which the user can find resources near the route, for example, water sources, shops, lookouts etc. Mainly it would be for long-distance hikers, so it has to be offline (route and tile storing).</p>
<p>It would be saved by the user before hiking, and the tiles would then be displayed from the OSM server using MapLibre/Leaflet, which would load a GPS path. The GPX route width would be determined with RouteBoxer, these areas would need to be saved.</p>
<p>My question is, how could I save the tiles and the routes which are in the RouteBoxer's boxes.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your response :)</p>
