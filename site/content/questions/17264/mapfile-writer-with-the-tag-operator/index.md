<p>Hello, I try to generate a map file with the mapfile-writer include the tag "operator" and his values. The tag comes from points with amenity=charging_station. I've already modify the tag-mapping.xml with a symbol for the charging stations an receive the point in the mapfile and rendering by Locus. But now, I can't see a way to get the "operator" value as a label on the map. It seems that the mapfile-writer include only tags like "name" or "adr:street" and "adr:housenumber". Is there any configuration file where I can include the tag "operator" to be written in the mapfile? Greetings from Hamburg, Heiner S</p>
