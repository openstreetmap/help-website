I cannot see the "Port Type" option in the statistics pull down menu that I saw as an option in one of the educational videos by Laura Chappell. I have statistics options such as Summary, Protocol Hierarchy, Conversations etc. I don't have the specific option "Port Type". As I said before, I noticed it in the educational video "Wireshark Functionality and Fundamentals" under section 6 "Examining basic Trace File Statistics." I also don't have the option "VoIP Calls," "SIP," among other features. Forgive my lack of specificity, I did not think I would get a response so quickly or at all really. :) Thanks for your time.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">statistics</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>25 Oct '10, 13:06</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a6eb7ac970d7ed0e9f01b5b7f7145304?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="schwei&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>schwei<br />
