<p>Go ahead and adjust the boundary. I'd be willing to bet that almost nobody who maps these places knows the actual boundary of a school with any degree of precision. I'm pretty sure user fledge didn't. Just extend it using visual cues obvious from the imagery. ESRI Clarity in that area is quite clear.</p>
<p>If you wish, you could also add several sport pitches based on the ESRI imagery. There is what looks like a leisure=playground to the rear of the Catholic school and on the north side of the big grassy pitch on the elementary school property. There are several pitches that might be used for basketball and a couple of soccer fields as well. A ground survey would resolve those questions.</p>
<p>Also, the council website suggests the big playing field, the Crescent Road Playing Field, is accessible from Crescent Road. I see what looks like a service road to that field in the SE corner of that field. You might want to add that to your list of edits.</p>
