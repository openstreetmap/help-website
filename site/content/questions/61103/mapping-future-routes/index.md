<p>I'm currently working on fixing SMART and DDOT routes in Metro Detroit, neither of which have been updated in several years.</p>
<p>I also know two major changes are coming to both systems in the near future. Several <code>route</code> relations that would be valid today won't be valid as of Jan 1st, and several more as of Jan 27th. Additionally, several new <code>route</code> relations <em>will</em> be valid as of that time, but are not as of today.</p>
<p>Is there anything I should do to mark the ones that are ending? Should I bother mapping the 598 and 599 at all (which will run for the last time on Dec 31st and 29th respectively, and yet are so new that they'd never been mapped before)?</p>
<p>As for the ones that are starting, should I put them in the map early or wait to upload those until their respective start dates? If the former, how should I mark them?</p>

<p>I've not done much public transport tagging so don't know the details of the actual tags. With that preface out of the way, I'd not bother adding routes what will be obsolete in a matter of weeks. With the update cycle that many other projects use it is not clear to me that any data consumer would actually use them until they were no longer operating.</p>
<p>With respect to the new routes that start after the first of the year, I would probably start adding them in now but use the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Lifecycle_prefix">lifecycle prefix of "planned:"</a> on the appropriate tags. Once the route starts operating, then a simple edit to remove the "planned:" prefix will make them visible to the data consumers.</p>
