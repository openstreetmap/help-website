In fact, most frames do not have an LLC header, since most frames today are transporting IPv4/IPv6 via ETHERNET II header. 802.3 does have an LLC header though. The different frame formats are indicated by the preceding start frame delimiter (Preamble) which ends in "11" instead of "10" for 802.3 formatted frames. You can't capture the preamble with Wireshark though.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>16 May '13, 15:28</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c578ba2967741f25aebd6afef702f432?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Jasper&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Jasper ♦♦<br />

It's not as if the preamble/SOF will tell you whether there's a type field or a length field - both types of frame begin with 7 bytes of 10101010, followed by 1 byte of 10101011, followed by the destination field, followed by the source field, followed by the 2-byte type/length field, followed by the payload.</p><p>(I don't have a copy of DIX 2.0, so I don't know whether it speaks of an 8-byte preamble or a 7-byte preamble and 1 byte of SFD.)</p><p>And the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame">"Ethernet frame" Wikipedia article</a> also says "Many years later, the 802.3x-1997 standard, and later versions of the 802.3 standard, formally approved of both types of framing.", so, as of 1997, frames with a type field and frames with a length field are both "802.3 frames"; a better terminology might be "frames with a type field" vs. "frames with a length field".</p></div><div id="comment-21235-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(17 May '13, 13:02)</span> Guy Harris ♦♦</div></div><span id="21238"></span><div id="comment-21238" class="comment"><div id="post-21238-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>The different frame formats are indicated by the preceding start frame delimiter (Preamble) which ends in "11" instead of "10" for 802.3 formatted frames.</p></blockquote><p>No, they're not, unless DIX version 2.0 had 10101010 as the last byte of the 8-byte sequence at the beginning of the frame. Don't be confused by DIX 1.0 (and maybe 2.0) calling the entire 8-byte sequence the preamble and 802.3 calling the first 7 bytes the preamble and the 8th byte the SOF delimiter - what goes on the wire for DIX and 802.3 is exactly the same.</p></div><div id="comment-21238-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(17 May '13, 13:08)</span> Guy Harris ♦♦</div></div><span id="21251"></span><div id="comment-21251" class="comment"><div id="post-21251-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I wasn't confused by preamble and SOF, I was just looking at a bad/unclear ethernet documentation as it seems.
