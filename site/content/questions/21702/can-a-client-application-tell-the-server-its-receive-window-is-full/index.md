When a receiver can't take more data it will reduce it's advertised Window Size to zero (once again diagnosed by Wireshark, which will tag the frame "Zero Window").</p><p>What <strong>will</strong> happen when you see a "Window Full" diagnosis is that the sender has pushed as much data to the line as it is allowed to, meaning that it has send out as many bytes in total as the client told it to be able to receive. That usually happens when you've got a fast connection with higher latency and indicates that the receiver's window size is too small to allow full speed transfers. Because as soon as the window is full the sender needs to stop sending further data until acknowledges come in.</p><p>In you case the receiver (in this case the "server") is almost getting into a "I can't take more data" situation in frame 79 (Window very close to 0) before recovering in frame 81, but that costs you about 7 milliseconds in delay. Those do not hurt much if this situation occurs only once in a while, but if the transfer is doing this kind of thing all the time even those small delays will add up to a long wait.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>03 Jun '13, 00:46</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c578ba2967741f25aebd6afef702f432?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Jasper&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Jasper ♦♦<br />

The sender sends with full speed until it has to stop to wait for acknowledgements coming in. Then it sends again with full speed and has to wait again. And so on.</p><p>You could try to either increase the receiving window size on your receiver to allow the sender to send data for a longer period of time, or make them process the incoming data faster. The latter of which is usually not that easy because you need to either optimize their application code or replace the hardware with something faster.</p><p><strong>Updated</strong>: replaced client/server with sender/receiver to avoid confusion</p></div><div id="comment-21706-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 Jun '13, 01:19)</span> Jasper ♦♦</div></div><span id="21708"></span><div id="comment-21708" class="comment"><div id="post-21708-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Ah, it's the client sending all the data to the server (upload to sharepoint), so i'll have a closer look at the server's specs, cheers Jasper!</p></div><div id="comment-21708-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 Jun '13, 02:04)</span> Marc</div></div><span id="21709"></span><div id="comment-21709" class="comment"><div id="post-21709-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Correct, sorry, I got mixed up with client/server labeling in my last comment, so I fixed it.</p></div><div id="comment-21709-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 Jun '13, 02:17)</span> Jasper ♦♦</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-21704" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-21704-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
