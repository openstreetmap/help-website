You'll see that the ack sequence numbers get further and further behind.</li></ol><p>Note that the sequence numbers are equivalent to "byte number" since every byte sent increases the sequence number by 1.</p><ol><li><p>Re: "advertised window from the server never shrinks": Look at the "calculated window size"in each ack.</p></li><li><p>Re: possible network issue (i.e., buffering): The fact that the advertised window size never decreases means that the receiver (server) always is indicating that it has room for 65K bytes in its buffers each time it acks data it has received. This means that the server is processing the bytes as they are received (emptying its receive buffer immediately). The sender however, knows that 65K bytes have been sent.</p></li></ol><p>So: the bytes must be in the pipeline since they apparently haven't yet reached the server.</p><p>[Update] A way to see the amount of data in the pipeline is to create a 'custom column' showing the field 'tcp.analysis.bytes_in_flight'.</p></div><div id="comment-29407-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 Feb '14, 11:34)</span> Bill Meier ♦♦</div></div><span id="29408"></span><div id="comment-29408" class="comment"><div id="post-29408-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Maybe your upload to .... is being speed limited ?? :)</p></div><div id="comment-29408-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 Feb '14, 11:56)</span> Bill Meier ♦♦</div></div><span id="29409"></span><div id="comment-29409" class="comment"><div id="post-29409-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Yes the wan is limited to 5Mbps</p></div><div id="comment-29409-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 Feb '14, 12:08)</span> any-one</div></div><span id="29410"></span><div id="comment-29410" class="comment"><div id="post-29410-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Something a bit less than 5 Mbps is, in fact, the final steady state throughput seen in the capture.</p><p>Do "Statistics !
