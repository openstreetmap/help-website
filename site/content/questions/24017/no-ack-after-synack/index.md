In frame 80 you see the SYN-ACK frame.</p><p>In frame 112 you see a ping request (ICMP ECHO request) from 192.168.42.115 to 172.16.8.2. This client is (probably) in the same subnet as the client in frame 70 (192.168.42.230).</p><p>Now, in frame 113 you see an <strong>ICMP Time-to-live exceeded</strong> for the packet in frame 112. This means there is either a routing loop somewhere or an intermediate device (firewall, IDS, etc.) dropped the packet and sent this rather unusual ICMP message.</p><p>The same problem could cause the missing ACK frame, if the SYN-ACK frame did not reach the client. If you did not capture on the client (or very, very near the client), you would see the frame in the capture, but you have no idea if it really reached the client!</p><p>So, here are some questions:</p><ul><li>Where exactly did you captured the traffic?</li><li>Is there a firewall involved?</li><li>How is the system 192.168.42.201 (sender of the ICMP TTL exceeded) involved in the whole game? It seems to be the default gateway in that subnet, as frame 70 is directed to the MAC address of 192.168.42.201.</li></ul><p>Regards<br />

But I don't think ICMP has got to do anything with the Phones not replying with an ACK. The captures have been taken ON the client itself. This clearly indicates that the SYN/ACK is reaching the phone but its still not responding with the ACK. Please filter the communication between 192.168.42.230 and 172.16.8.2.
