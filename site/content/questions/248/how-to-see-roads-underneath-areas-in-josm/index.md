<p>There seem to be groups of people who continue amenities' boundaries right up to the street centre-line, so that they share nodes and ways.</p>
<p>I can sort of see the point of this with landuse=* stuff, if the intention is to partition every aspect of the Earth's surface to being one sort of landuse or other.</p>
<p>But, where's the point in forcing parks, buildings, rivers etc all so that they reach the centre-line of the road, thus making that area appear bigger, especially when there's quite obviously a pavement between the area and the road's kerb (let alone the centre-line) ? Where are items of street furniture supposed to go ? There's nowhere between the road and the area to put them !</p>
<p>If this sort of thing is legitimate, how does one get JOSM to show the roads on top, so people can actually edit them (or at least see what their names are) ? I have used filtering to hide landuse=*, but in my current editing endeavors, I have to hide amenity=college, amenity=police, leisure=garden, and a whole lot more depending on where I'm moving to. In any case, I don't necessarily want to hide them, just to have them treated as layer=some_very_large_negative_number.</p>

<p>There are at least two separate issues here at once. One is about the sharing of nodes and ways for different uses. The other about handling such cases in JOSM. Can you split up those questions?</p>

<p>It's a good question, and one I'd love to be able to answer better. Perhaps at the end of your question it should just point out the difficulty of editing in JOSM (and even more so in Potlatch) rather than asking further specific questions about how to do it.</p>

<p>In JOSM in this situation you may need to select one or the other of the overlapping ways. There are various ways of doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A middle-click reveals a context menu showing the different tags of all the elements under the mouse.</li>
<li>Holding down Ctrl will allow you to click the menu to change the selection.</li>
<li>Alternatively repeated middle clicking will cycle the selection.</li>
<li>If you do not have a middle mouse button, hold down the 'Alt' key on the right side of your keyboard and do a repeated left-click to cycle the selection</li>
</ul>
<p>(This is as I wrote <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Advanced_editing#Unglueing_and_untangling">in the JOSM Guide</a>)</p>
<p>Earlier you are asking whether this kind of data is a good idea in general. ...good question.</p>
<p>It certainly makes it a little harder to work with the data (and I can understand you asking both questions at once, to make this point) I used to <em>always</em> avoid overlapping way-segments, but these days I'm using them quite a lot for building outlines. In my opinion you should not take the polygon of a park right up to share the way-segments of a road centreline, unless maybe there is no pavement or anything separating the area of park from the road. But this is certainly something people take varying approaches to, and it might be good to try to agree on some clearer guidelines. No clear answers at this stage I'm afraid.</p>

<p>I certainly agree about areas (and the road right-of-way should be a long rectangle with landuse=highway, comprising the paved area, sidewalks, and grass). But as long as people join them to roads, you're probably best off using the filter feature. I use it for boundaries, and would use it for areas too if I did a lot of JOSM editing in downtowns. It's simple enough to toggle on the left side if you need to edit one of the hidden objects.</p>
