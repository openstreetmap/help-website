<p>Yes, this should be possible by using <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Conditional_restrictions">conditional restrictions</a>. They support various kinds of restrictions, transportation modes and conditions. Time and date conditions can be specified by using the same syntax as for <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours">opening_hours</a>. But this part can be a bit tricky, especially if you want to match only certain weekends.</p>

<p>I'll agree that this the way to represent it. But the rendering on OSM.org will not magically change when the condition is met. So the answer to the original question would be "No, it is not possible to set OSM to automatically close, reopen, etc." I also wonder whether any of the current navigation systems based on OSM honors those conditional restrictions.</p>

<p>Someone gave a good example for tagging this kind is situation:<a href="/questions/41587/tagging-problem-street-one-way-at-certain-times-one-way-the-other-way-at-other-times">https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/41587/tagging-problem-street-one-way-at-certain-times-one-way-the-other-way-at-other-times</a> Times here are much more simple, as said before it remains to be seen if in your situation it's possible this way.</p>
<p>Conditional one way streets etc are not that uncommon. If they get mapped enough, someone is bound to make a navigation algorithm that uses the data some day.</p>
