<p>For my local fire-station I would like to use <a href="https://maposmatic.osm-baustelle.de/">this</a> OSM-based service for exporting a map to PDF comprising a fire hydrant layer. Before I can actually export the fire-hydrant-map, I need to create those hydrants in OSM and there are two open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The OSM fire hydrant data should also be used to create a list of hydrants grouped by streets. If the hydrant is placed on only one street (no traffic junction) I would just use the <strong>addr:*-tag</strong> to denote the placement. If the hydrant is placed within a traffic junction, both streets should relate to the hydrant. I have found <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_Features/addrN">this</a> proposal describing a way of denoting multiple addresses. Is this a somewhat correct way to mark both streets if the hydrant is placed on a traffic junction or is there a better way?</li>
<li>Sometimes streets are extensive and contain multiple hydrants. Therefore it is a good practice to denote the nearest actual building address to find the hydrant quickly (on a printed list without a map). Is there a better way to denote such relationship other than using the <strong>addr*-tag</strong> (e.g. housenumber - although the hydrant does not actually belong to this address)?</li>

<p>While I don't have a solution for your issues, I would say that tagging hydrants with addr* tags doesn't seem right. You would be saying that fire hydrant X has a mailing address of 123 Main Street, which just doesn't make sense.</p>
