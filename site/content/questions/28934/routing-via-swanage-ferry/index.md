<p>I recently tried to get a route from Swanage to Bournemouth (UK) using my Garmin Etrex Legend HCx and a gmapsupp.img map I built using mkgmap from OSM data dated 5 Sep 13. The quickest and shortest route would be via the Swanage Car Ferry (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/147985346">way 147985346</a>), and a while (6 months?) ago this would have worked - I've had many routes via this ferry before. But recently something has broken it and the ferry seems no longer to be recognised as a routable way. Instead a 20-mile detour all round Poole harbour is obtained.</p>
<p>I've tried the Cloudmade website today (link from the routing/on-line routers Wiki page) and got a similar silly answer to that from my GPS. It's not clear to me which version of the OSM database the Cloudmade site is using.</p>
<p>I've eyeballed the raw OSM data for way 147985346 and can't see anything obviously wrong, but I'm basically just a user and I don't really know what to look for. Can anyone help? I don't know if other ferries are maybe similarly affected.</p>

<p>As a test you could split the route into three bits, Swanage to ferry. ferry to ferry, and ferry Bournemouth. Try each route in the Garmin in turn to locate the problem. But I would suspect the routing choices you have selected on the Garmin is the problem.</p>

<p>E.g. <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/165975362">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/165975362</a> has <code>access = permissive</code> and <code>toll = yes</code>. But that seem to not have changed in the last 6 months.</p>
<p>Not sure what has changed with your routing. Cloudmade and your GPS routing may simply not "like" ferries and try to avoid them.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who answered or commented..</p>
<p>The problem is indeed the "avoid toll roads" setting in my GPS routing parms. Unchecking this makes everything work fine again.</p>
<p>I haven't consciously changed this setting ever AFAICR, so it might have been accidental finger trouble. Alternatively, checking back in the change history for way 147985346 shows that the toll=yes tag was added on 3/6/12. I tend to make a new map every 2-3 months, so I'm a little surprised I haven't noticed this before now. But it is possible: I know the area reasonably well (I mapped a good part of Swanage and around originally) so I often don't bother with routing when there.</p>
<p><span>@aseerel4c26</span>: (I assume you're some sort of moderator?) The "about" for this board says: "This site is for everyone who needs help with OpenStreetMap. You might be a new mapper; you might want to embed OpenStreetMap into your web page; or you might be a company wanting to use OpenStreetMap data. Your questions might be technical, practical or legal. No matter - you’re in the right place." So, as an infrequent user, if I should have posted somewhere else, perhaps this text should be amended to make it more specific?</p>

<p>I guessed "toll roads" because I did exactly the same thing myself a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>meta: <span></span><span>@brgmx5</span>: In case it was not clear, I was referring to the "Things that are less welcome" part in the FAQ.</p>
<p>Many people here are a moderator (see further down in the FAQ), only very few people are "admins" (full power). I cannot change the "about" text (only admins can, I think). However, the short about text is right - you ARE in the right place. I think we want people not to hesitate to ask and walk away. A not optimally(!) placed question is far better than someone being disappointed of OSM. … And, as you see below <span></span><span>@SomeoneElse</span> seems to think slightly different about this topic.</p>
