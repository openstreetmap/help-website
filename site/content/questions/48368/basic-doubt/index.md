You can be connected to a Wi-Fi network, so you can also be "not connected" to a Wi-Fi network. Are you talking about cracking Wi-Fi passwords of networks to which you're not connected? Or are you talking about being connected to a Wi-Fi network, and cracking passwords on that network, when that network is not itself connected to the Internet?</p></div><div id="comment-48430-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(10 Dec '15, 12:30)</span> Guy Harris ♦♦</div></div><span id="48436"></span><div id="comment-48436" class="comment"><div id="post-48436-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>yeah I am talking about cracking Wi-Fi password of network to which Iam not connected</p></div><div id="comment-48436-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(10 Dec '15, 15:14)</span> Lcwld</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-48368" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-48368-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

It seems that you misunderstood my question, My aim is not to crack wifi. I want to find out whether we will get the information packet of some wifi connection even when i am not connected to internet? For Ex: Let us say that I am connected to internet via ethernet then will I get information packets of some other wifi whose password I don't know and I am not connected to it. Thanks in advance</p></div><div id="comment-48385-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(09 Dec '15, 10:55)</span> Lcwld</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-48369" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-48369-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

If you are connected to LAN and trace with Wireshark on WiFi, you'll see WiFi packets. (you will however require monitor mode and likely promiscuous mode as well, so not from Windows)</p><p>If you are connected to a LAN, and someone else is connected to your LAN via WiFi, then the WiFi router will strip out the 802 frame headers and send the information you you via normal Ethernet TCP. As long as you are capturing the incoming traffic, the packets are meant for you or have a HUB, yes you can. Nothing special required.</p><p>If you are connected to your LAN and your neighbour is connected to his WiFi; no, You wont and it is very likely highly illegal to try. If you are not authenticated to the WiFi you are capturing you'll get encrypted garbage unless the WiFi owner is an idiot (or in a funny mood and way cleverer than you)</p><p>I'm not entirely sure where you are going with this, but if you need to ask, don't go there.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>15 Dec '15, 01:32</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/05ba95262a3352e3af4ba69c0ec0dff2?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="DarrenWright&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>DarrenWright<br />
