<p>Can you post the way ids, and explain how you got the file (was it via the Export tab, or a third-party provider)?</p>

<p>It is also possible that the replicated ways are really in the OSM database. They might belong to a landuse area or an administrative boundary. Check the tags. Or it can be simply a mistake by a newcomer converting a GPX to a road and not merging with the existing data. So check with an editor and the real DB if your replicated ways are like this originaly or if it comes from an export issue.</p>

<p>I guess Danielnet <em>may</em> mean a road being split into several segments, which of course all have the same name tag but different nodes at different positions and usually different other tags. That is a totally valid and often used way to represent one road in our database. As Richard said, some example way ids would be very helpful here.</p>
