<p>Hi folks, after a bit of advice:</p>
<p>There's a railway level crossing near me at Northumberland Park station in London (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.60222&amp;mlon=-0.05381#map=19/51.60222/-0.05381)">https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.60222&amp;mlon=-0.05381#map=19/51.60222/-0.05381)</a> which has been closed. The current situation is that the road is blocked off with construction site barriers just before reaching the crossing, and the adjacent pedestrian footbridge is still open, and the end result of the work that's happening there is that the crossing will be permanently closed and ramps added to the bridge (according to the railway company's website at <a href="https://www.networkrail.co.uk/feeds/tottenham-level-crossing-closed-to-make-way-for-major-railway-improvements/)">https://www.networkrail.co.uk/feeds/tottenham-level-crossing-closed-to-make-way-for-major-railway-improvements/)</a></p>
<p>What's the best way to mark this on OSM? Should I just remove the level crossing nodes and associated section of road, or is there a way to mark that they were there but are being/have been removed? And for the changes to the bridge, I assume I should leave it as-is until the ramp access is built?</p>

<p>There are probably many answers to this question. Personally, I would delete the small section of road which crosses the tracks. I would also delete the crossings on the tracks. I would add a "no exit" node to the ends of the road just prior to the tracks. The company's website indicates the pedestrian bridge is under construction. So, you can add items to the pedestrian bridge and add a tag, "construction=yes" to each new part added.</p>
