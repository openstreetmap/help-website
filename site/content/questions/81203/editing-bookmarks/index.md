<p>Hello,</p>
<p>this is a volunteer help site about OpenStreetMap, which doesn't include any bookmark functionality. The information submitted to OSM is always public, either through the main database, or through the Notes. It is a collaborative project, meaning other users will improve on the data you submitted.</p>
<p>It seems that you used Maps.me to edit the database, which is not always the best way. Probably changes in Maps.me are your problem. IIRC Maps.me removed their editing feature of existing objects after numerous complaints, now only new objects can be created.</p>
<p>Maps.me have never been a good OSM editor IMHO. If you have an Android device, have a look at Vespucci, a bit complicated but really powerful. Or from a computer, on openstreetmap.org, you'll find a decent web editor. If you want complete control of what you are doing, JOSM is best. <a href="https://learnosm.org/en/beginner/">More information</a>.</p>
<p>If you just want bookmarks on your device, I suggest having a look at OsmAnd, where the management of these is much more powerful.</p>
<p>If I may emphasize, what you did are not bookmarks, these are <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/JosteinB/history">public</a> changes to a collaborative database.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
