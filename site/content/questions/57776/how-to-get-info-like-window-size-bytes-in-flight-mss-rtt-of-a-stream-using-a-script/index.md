Is there any tool or script using tshark or other tools to get these info and populate to excel sheet. Basic is to parse the file and get these details, later i can manipulate how to present them. Looked on web, there are so many tools like pcaplusplus splitter etc, but i need cmd line options so that I can prepare a perl/python/bash script to automate this.
