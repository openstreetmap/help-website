<p>I have been trying out the stava slide tool in id (<a href="http://labs.strava.com/slide/">strava slide</a>) and after recording some gps tracks over the weekend to check against, I found it does an excellent job on some of the bush tracks with little, if any extra editing required after the slide.</p>
<p>But I have not been able to save my work using the <a href="http://strava.github.io/iD/#background=Bing&amp;map=16.97/-122.54464/38.05472">iD editor integration</a> It seems to hang on the save part. I am a new user to iD but nothing unexpected has happened until that point. I also logged in as part of the save and ok'd a box of questions that popped up.</p>
<p>Anyone else have this problem? Is there a newby trap here?</p>
<p>iMac 10.9.3 Firefox 29.0.1</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Could not get to save in <em>Firefox</em> but was fine in <em>Safari</em> Version 7.0.4 :)</p>

<p>Strava Slide worked for me including saving. Can't remember if I used Firefox or Safari, I think Firefox.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe was that it was the first time I'd used iD and I was not comfortable with it. I'd love it if a JOSM plug-in for slide was developed.</p>
