The idea is to place a few <code>WIFI</code> adapters in several locations in a small building, each tracking signal strength and <code>MAC</code> address and storing it in a database. Based on the signal strength to different adapters at the same time, we can get an (in)accurate position of the device (<code>MAC</code>).</p><p>There are two <code>SSIDs</code> in the building, both with <code>WPA-PWD</code> encryption. There will also be devices that are not associated with the network. Since I don't want to install 3 adapters on each location (one for each network) I want to get the signal strength in monitor mode and only switch the channel between the two <code>SSIDs</code>.</p><p>Using <code>Kali</code> and <code>tshark</code> i'm able to capture the signal strength using:</p><pre><code>tshark -i mon0 -T fields -e wlan.sa -e radiotap.dbm_antsignal</code></pre><p>The problem however is that I receive very little data from my test device (android phone). If I open the <code>WIFI</code> manager and it start scanning for networks in the area I capture the broadcast packets, but no other data at all. I suspected it to be because of the <code>WPA</code> encryption and changed to an open network and it worked. I see a constant stream of packets from my android phone.</p><p>I turned back to the <code>WPA</code> network and setup <code>tshark</code> using decryption</p><pre><code>tshark -i mon0 -o wlan.enable_decryption:TRUE -o &quot;uat:80211_keys:\&quot;wpa-pwd\&quot;,\&quot;Passphrase:SSID\&quot;&quot;</code></pre><p>I disconnected my phone from the network, enabled monitor mode and then reconnected the device, to make sure I received the <code>four-way handshake</code>. Now I do receive some data packets, but nowhere near the amount I'm actually sending/downloading. At moments I receive about 10 a minute and then nothing at all for a few minutes.</p><p>I tried with the folowing setups</p><ul><li><code>Kali linux</code> in <code>VMWare</code> on windows 10, with an <code>ALFA AWUS036H</code> (RT8187 chipset)</li><li>I dont receive any data packets from <code>WPA</code> protected networks</li><li><code>Kali linux ARM</code> on <code>Raspberry Pi 3 model b</code>, same USB adapter</li><li>I dont receive any data packets from <code>WPA</code> protected networks</li><li><code>Kali linux</code> live boot USB, <code>Qualcomm Atheros AR938x</code> adapter</li><li>I receive a few datapackets from <code>WPA</code> protected networks</li></ul><p>My questions:</p><ol><li>Is decrypting necessary if I only want <code>MAC</code> and signal strength?</li><li>Why don't I receive most of the data packets being sent?</li><li>Is there a better way to use <code>WIFI</code> for <code>IPS</code>?</li></ol></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags"><span class="post-tag tag-link-wireless" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;wireless&#39;">wireless</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-kali-linux" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;kali-linux&#39;">kali-linux</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-monitor-mode" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;monitor-mode&#39;">monitor-mode</span></div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>10 Apr '17, 06:28</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/313980c5c01ddb36a889b71e4104f177?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="DrZiggy&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>DrZiggy</span><br />
