<p>I am in my twelfth year of contributing to OSM. I have used JOSM for my editing almost all of that time. I continue to be frustrated, however, that no alterations can be made to changeset comments and data sources if uploaded with errors in them. I find no fault with JOSM's drop-down boxes, whatsoever - indeed, they are extremely helpful when dealing with a range of edits. I am not infallible, though, and I have selected an item in error or made a spelling mistake from time to time. Rather, it is that my changeset having been created, I am unable to alter it. I dislike, intensely, looking at my edits in OSM and seeing the errors staring at me in the Changeset column or knowing my apparent source bears no relation to the edit, itself.</p>
<p>I do not expect the situation to change, but I feel better for expressing my feelings.</p>

<p>This Q&amp;A system is for seeking answers, not for seeking consolation ;) hence I will close your question. Seeking consolation and support from like-minded people is best done on the mailing lists or irc/slack etc.</p>
<p>As for the technical situation, at the moment the best you can do is add a comment to your own changeset explaining the mistake which I would recommend doing - it is better than nothing and anyone investigating your change more closely will see it. If we wanted to add the option of modifying your changeset comment we'd likely want to have some kind of "audit trail" i.e. a chance to inspect earlier versions and see who changed what when, a requirement that somewhat increases the complexity of it all.</p>
<p>But all is not lost! If you work on this a bit more you might be able to, if not deliver code yourself, at least find out exactly what changes are required and then, when the next micro grant programme comes up or when there's another Google Summer of Code, you could put this idea out there and see if you find someone who adopts it.</p>
