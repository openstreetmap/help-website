<p>I am trying to integrate OpenStreetMap into a React Native project. But I can't find any library or anything related to React Native in their GitHub account.</p>
<p>The only thing I can find relating to these to topics is the link below, in which there is no proper answer.</p>

<p>But I heard once that Mapbox uses OpenStreetMap as their source. Mapbox suggests a good way to integrate it into a React Native project:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mapbox/react-native-mapbox-gl">https://github.com/mapbox/react-native-mapbox-gl</a></p>
<p>Is there a way to integrate OpenStreetMap into a React Native project or is it the case there's not proper support for it yet.</p>

<p>OpenStreetMap is basically just a big pile of data. React Native is just a software development framework. Without more information about what you're actually trying to do, it's impossible to answer this question.</p>
<p>Are you trying to create something that needs to be self-contained and work offline, or would online access to internet servers be possible from whatever you're creating?</p>
<p>What do you want to use OSM data for - display of maps, searching for things, routing to things, data analysis, something else?</p>
<p>Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant">famous story</a> you probably have an idea of what OpenStreetMap is, but it probably isn't the whole picture.</p>
