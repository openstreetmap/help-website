There are several devices connected to the home router which can be successfully monitored. Http traffic from all devices such as Windows 7 and even iOS devices can be captured via WiFI.</p><p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> No http traffic can be captured from Android devices. Traffic from all devices such as Windows 7 and even iOS devices can be captured, EXCEPT TRAFFIC FROM ANDROID DEVICES. There is however a connection with Android devices because a TCP protocol has been 'intercepted', however no http traffic is shown. Problem is initially thought to be because of the several 802.11b/g/n settings, but the router, Macbook WLAN adapter as well as all devices support 802.11n.</p><p><strong>GOAL:</strong> Capture and monitor also, and especially, Android http traffic on Macbook MacOSX Mavericks.</p><p><strong>KEY INFORMATION:</strong> There is no physical access to other devices, meaning the option to set up certain ports or configure network settings on other devices, is not available.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">capture android http monitor</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>14 Jan '15, 08:00</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b350fd07242a09d7cbf1697f71fa6ea2?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Sher-e-Arya&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Sher-e-Arya<br />
