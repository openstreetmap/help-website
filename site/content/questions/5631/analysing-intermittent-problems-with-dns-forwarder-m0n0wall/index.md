I have a 'server' which has two nic's eth0 is connected to the ADSL modem/router and eth1 is connected to a switch connecting all pc's on the subnet.</p><p>The server runs vmware server and runs 3 VM's: - ubuntu bridged to eth0 - ubuntu bridged to eth1 - m0n0wall which acts as the firewall/gateway/dhcp server for the subnet. the "WAN" interface is bridged to eth0 and the "LAN" interface to eth1</p><p>At this stage only the dhcp server is enabled and dns forwarding so that machines on the subnet can access the internet.</p><p>The setup works DNS names are resolved and 'most' websites work fine. ping to various hosts returns the same values via the m0n0wall as directly through the modem/router gateway.</p><p>However, some sites take ages to load, or don't load at all. But not always. www.bbc.co.uk is one example.</p><p>I'm using wireshark to get to the bottom of the problem but so far i've only found that the times the request fails the server (bbc) sends an window-update as a response to the packet with the GET request. After that the client retransmits two more times and the server finally responds with 'bad tcp'.</p><p>What i'm trying to find out is whether i've got a config problem in the m0n0wall or whether its more fundamental e.g packets getting mangled etc.</p><p>any pointers would be appreciated.</p><p>cheers, Michael</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags"><span class="post-tag tag-link-firewall" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;firewall&#39;">firewall</span></div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>10 Aug '11, 14:13</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c3cd54a3622322dbeef48d98008bbe06?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="mmalaprop&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>mmalaprop</span><br />

Your ADSL modem/router (192.168.1.1) it telling your client (192.168.1.95 after nat, 192.168.2.2 before nat) that it needs to fragment the IP datagram to forward it (see frames 28, 50, 89). However the m0n0wall does not seem to forward these ICMP packets. So your client does not learn that it needs to send smaller packets.</p><p>You can solve this by looking at the ICMP packet in frame 28 and extract the MTU of the next hop. You can then change the MTU size on both sides of the m0n0wall FW accordingly.</p></div><div id="comment-5657-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(11 Aug '11, 12:29)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">SYN-bit ♦♦</span></div></div><span id="5658"></span><div id="comment-5658" class="comment"><div id="post-5658-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>That did it! thanks. Just so this is clear in my head... the client (192.168.1.95) sent a packet (frame 24 say, 1514 bytes). this had the DF flag set and the router dropped that packet and sent a 'this is to big for me to forward - please fragment'.</p><p>what i don't quite understand:</p><ol><li>why wasn't the monowall passing the ICMP packet back as its only 590bytes. . . i only changed the mtu on the client winXP side to match the router...</li><li>why was a 1514 size packet generated the default on windows is 1500</li></ol></div><div id="comment-5658-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(11 Aug '11, 15:51)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">mmalaprop</span></div></div><span id="5669"></span><div id="comment-5669" class="comment"><div id="post-5669-score" class="comment-score">1</div><div class="comment-text"><p>Actually, to be precies, the meaning of the ICMP paket is:</p><p>"You want me to forward a IP packet without fragmenting, however, it is too big for the link towards the next hop.
