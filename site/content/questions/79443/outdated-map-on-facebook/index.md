<p>Hi! I have had the same problem since June 2020 - although i just a while ago understood that i had to change the location here in OSM by my self.</p>
<p>Anyways - everything SHOULD be okay now, but it is not. There is still the old OSM points in Facebook map and everytime i try to PIN our new address to Facebook it says ERROR.</p>
<p>In OSM and google and all its correct - Helsingin aikuisopisto is on Runeberginkatu 22-24 and not anymore in Töölöntullinkatu 8 - EXCEPT in Facebook.</p>
