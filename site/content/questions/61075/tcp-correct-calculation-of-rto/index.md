I also think it seems reasonable that setting a minRTO shouldn't affect the RTO calculation, but it also wouldn't surprise me if it did, either because of a bug or some other issue in the particular TCP stack. It would seem useful to see how things perform with TCP using its default settings, since the RTO behavior of the server certainly doesn't look right.</p></div><div id="comment-61208-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 May '17, 08:05)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">djdawson</span></div></div><span id="61209"></span><div id="comment-61209" class="comment"><div id="post-61209-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Your "answer" has been converted to a comment as that's how this site works.

If you look at the following screenshots of the Time Sequence graph of the Server-to-Client traffic you can clearly see the client waiting for each packet for just over 200 msec before sending the ACK for the retransmitted packet, which was probably sent as a result of the RTO at the server. Since Nagel and Delayed ACK are not negotiated between TCP endpoints, it would be necessary to disable these options on the client in order to verify if that's the issue.</p><p><img src="https://osqa-ask.wireshark.org/upfiles/TSG2_VcfxRaZ.png" alt="alt text" /></p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>02 May '17, 16:45</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a446b2537577b08421cfd0c9b544b19e?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="djdawson&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>djdawson</span><br />
