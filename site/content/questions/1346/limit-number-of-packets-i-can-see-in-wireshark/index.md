If it always crashes at roughly the same packet number you should check if your disk is full. Wireshark captures into a temp file whenever you start capturing, and maybe that temp file is on a disk that doesn't have much room left.</p><p>You can see the name of the temp file in the status bar while you're capturing to find out where it is. Or you open the "About" dialog, go to the "Folders" tab and take a look at the "Temp" value.</p><p>If you have enough disk space you could try to capture by just running dumpcap instead. It is usually found in the same folder you installed Wireshark to. There are a couple of parameters that you can use to specify the NIC you want to capture on and where to write the trace file to.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>14 Dec '10, 09:38</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c578ba2967741f25aebd6afef702f432?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Jasper&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Jasper ♦♦<br />

This is not always easy/feasible depending on what you're trying to analyze, but in your case it sounds like you are only concerned with certain UDP packets. Furthermore, if you know the UDP port numbers or the specific host(s) involved, you can also further qualify the capture filter with that information as well. Click <a href="http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureFilters">here</a> for more information on capture filters.</li><li>Don't capture in promiscuous mode unless you need to.</li><li>If you don't necessarily care about capturing every byte of every packet, you might choose to reduce the snaplen in order to limit the number of bytes captured per packet.</li><li>Run dumpcap with the "-b filesize:NUM" option to limit the size of each capture file to some reasonable maximum. This will make each capture file a little easier to deal with. If you need to analyze data split across multiple files, you can always recombine the capture files later using mergecap.</li><li>Run dumpcap with the "-b files:NUM" option to ensure that you don't completely fill your disk, which could happen, depending on much data you are capturing and for how long.</li></ul><p>For full dumpcap usage, refer to the <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/AppToolsdumpcap.html">Section D.4 of the user guide</a>.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>14 Dec '10, 18:05</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/55158e2322c4e365a5e0a4a0ac3fbcef?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="cmaynard&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>cmaynard ♦♦<br />

It sounds like you don't have enough memory to analyze the complete capture file and need to split it up further. Or perhaps you're running an older version of Wireshark with known bugs that have been fixed in later releases. You haven't mentioned anything about your particular OS, Wireshark and [Win|lib]pcap versions.

It's possible you've encountered a dissector bug. If so, it might also be possible that this bug has already been fixed in the 1.4.x branch, so you might consider upgrading to 1.4.2. If an upgrade to 1.4.2 doesn't help, to help narrow down the problem, you could use editcap to recursively split the capture file until you're left with a much smaller capture file in which the problem is still evident, then you could post it to the developer's list or open a bug report, attaching the small capture file so someone could take a look at it.</p></div><div id="comment-1363-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(15 Dec '10, 13:35)</span> cmaynard ♦♦</div></div><span id="1364"></span><div id="comment-1364" class="comment"><div id="post-1364-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Each UDP packet only contain data because is what I send.

The error message seems to indicate that Wireshark can't allocated memory. This is more likely pointing to RAM. On average if wireshark needs about 3 bytes of memory for every byte in the capture - so do get to the point in your capture of around 200MB, Wireshark will probably need about 600MB of RAM. Do you have enough RAM memory + swap space allocated? You can try running "top" in another window and watch what is happening to available memory while wireshark is loading your file.</p><p>Alternatively, there could be a bug in the dissector triggered by the packet you are reading. You might want to try and use "editcap" to either split up your capture into smaller chunks or isolate to the exact packets where the problem is arising. If it is a particular packet causing an issue you can then file a bug report.</p><p>Martin</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>15 Dec '10, 22:12</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/57fbbe2a1e14ccc2a681a28886e5a484?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="martyvis&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>martyvis<br />
