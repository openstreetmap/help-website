<p>I also find it humorous that Hoover Dam is tagged as going into service in 1931 and closing in 1936. I'm fairly certain it's still in service. :)</p>

<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/8189/alester">@alester</a>: I wonder what that was <em>supposed</em> to mean - according to Wikipedia, <em>construction</em> has started in 1931, and finished in 1936. I don't think that the lifecycle tags have a provision for this; also, IMNSHO the construction dates are not something that's mappable (unless currently in long-term progress).</p>

<p>After some deliberation, I have decided to make a minimal edit and only fix the incorrect <code>*_date</code> tags. Hopefully it's tagged better now - I wouldn't want to trigger an edit war, since it's a high-profile structure (pun not intended), so I didn't touch the <code>building</code> tag.</p>

<p>In general, dams are not buildings, though I'm sure there are a few exceptions. Hoover Dam has been tagged as a building since it was added to the map, likely to <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tagging_for_the_renderer">make it show on the map</a> because <code>waterway=dam</code> wasn't rendered on the standard rendering until <a href="https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/pull/991">a year ago</a>. There's really no way you could validly consider Hoover Dam to be a building, because it's a solid block of concrete with only the occasional interior service space.</p>

<p>Consider every structure that can be entered through an entrance with doors and windows to be a building. A dam man_made=dam could be build out of dirt, stone, sand, concrete or steel. The OSM rules should be considered to be part of a change. Its a ships rule, the beacons are changed if the tide changes. OSM should enter into today.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it isn't that simple. For example, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3Xq9njkDRKk">here</a>'s a building with no windows (it's a proposed legal marijuana growing operation; sorry for the Google).</p>
<p>The material out of which a dam is constructed is irrelevant when determining whether it's a building or not. It only matters whether it has any significant interior space, which dams generally do not.</p>

<p>A lot of man made structures have facilities for people to walk in and through at least for service purposes: bridges, communication towers, sewers and yes, dams. Larger dams usually have a service tunnel where inspections are made and measuring instruments for leakage and settling are installed. Additionally, there might be machine rooms for water inlets our outlets, power generators etc.</p>
<p>The question is what do we want to convey with the message "this is a building"? For the usual detached house, apartment building, barn, church etc this is clear. For the rest I regret there is no clear line we can draw. There's one big motorway bridge here in the city which has large service corridors. I would still do with highway=* and bridge=yes. Then there is another bridge which houses some bigger rooms that have been converted to artists' workshops. That might warrant to give this bridge its own building tag.</p>
<p>For the dam I would see it similarly. Is it only a service tunnel that gets inspected once a day, just leave it with dam. But are there also additional facilities like machine rooms in there make it a building (or map both separately if possible).</p>
<p>I guess as so often the answer is "it depends on your gut feeling". &lt;shrug&gt;</p>

<p>Hmh. If I were mapping from scratch, I would surely tag the powerhouse and both the Nevada and Arizona wings as "building"; for the dam structure itself, I don't think it's necessary.</p>
<p>Now - is the <code>building</code> tag on this dam incorrect enough for <em>removal</em>? I'm not sure, so I would choose the usual way and leave it alone.</p>
