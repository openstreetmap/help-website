I know that monitoring of Gb interface as such is possible with Wireshark, since BSSGB protocol is a supported Wireshark display filter. But the problem now is with Ciphering switched on in the network (which you normally have switched off in test networks in order to monitor signalling messages on any protocol analyser).</p><p>Does anybody have any hint how I can use Wireshark also in this special scenario? Is it possible to monitor Gr interface in parallel and somehow tell Wireshark to take the ciphering key from there to decipher the Gb interface? But anyway, Gr interface would use MAP protocol, and this I can't find in Wireshark display filter list.</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance and Best Regards,</p><p>Carsten</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">ip over ciphering gb</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>23 May '11, 09:12</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9f1ca38e1209a3d108ce3264b81fb798?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Carsten&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Carsten<br />
