<p>This is not a mapping question per se, but answers will help me plan and coordinate mtb rides with others better -- which is the primary means I currently use to gather mapping data for enhancing OSM.</p>
<p>I currently use <a href="http://bikeroutetoaster.com">bikeroutetoaster.com</a> to plan mtb rides. The site allows me to draw a planned route for our ride, and then get a .gpx file containing the route, which I then upload to my gps.</p>
<p>My "route" shows up on my gps (Garmin 60Cx) as a "track", so I use Garmin's TrackBack feature to follow the planned route for the ride.</p>
<p>After the ride, I use the trace generated by the ride ("follow road" was turned off, of course) to do mapping at OSM. It all works great.</p>
<p>However, after getting the .gpx from the website, but before uploading it to my gps, I would like to edit the .gpx file (in as automated a fashion as possible) to add named waypoints along the planned track -- i.e., "mile marker" points.</p>
<p>(I don't want to create them during the ride; I want them to already be present along the track that I will be following during the ride.)</p>
<p>These mile-marker points will facilitate communication among those of us using the route. I would like the points to show up on the gps, and also on printed maps if possible.</p>
<p>It would like to be able to specify: the distance interval between the points along the route (e.g., 1 mile, 1/2 mile, 1/4 mile, etc.), and a text prefix (e.g., "x" to get the points created as: x001, x002, x003, etc.).</p>
<p>The points would be added as a sequence of numbered points -- the prefix plus sequential integers would be nice.</p>
<p>However, I don't want the mile-marker points to be named using only numbers, since that is how my gps auto-names new waypoints that I create during the ride -- it would be confusing.</p>
<p>I use use a computer running MS Windows.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for any answers, pointers to OSM wiki pages or advice!</p>

<p>You could do most of this using <a href="http://www.gpsbabel.org">GPSBabel</a>. You can use a <a href="http://www.gpsbabel.org/htmldoc-1.4.2/filter_transform.html">transform filter</a> in GPSBabel to convert from a track to a series of waypoints.</p>
<p>Note this will create a waypoint for every trackpoint, which for a detailed track is probably more than you want. You could first use a <a href="http://www.gpsbabel.org/htmldoc-1.4.2/filter_simplify.html">simplify filter</a> or <a href="http://www.gpsbabel.org/htmldoc-1.4.2/filter_position.html">position filter</a> to reduce the number of points. Also, this will name the waypoints as WPT001, WPT002 etc, I don't know if there's any way in GPSBabel to change this prefix. But you could output in GPX format, then just use a text editor to change the prefix for all of the waypoints if you want.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply, and I will look into GPSBabel further. However, what I am seeking is to leave the track as-is, and add the named waypoints along the track, at user defined intervals. I don't see that in the GPSBabel manual (yet). (Anyone have any ideas?)</p>

<p>Once you've got your track-converted-to-waypoints-and-simplified (and your original track) you could just conbine the two in a text editor to get a GPX with both in. If you're unsure of the format, have a look at this one:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/trace/1008448/data">https://www.openstreetmap.org/trace/1008448/data</a></p>
<p>(that just happened to be the most recent public GPX trace with both waypoints and trackpoints in it at the time of writing this)</p>
