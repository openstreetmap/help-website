<p>Hi,</p>
<p>when I just added a "highway=path" at 6.38817 East and 53.99132 North (Tom Bellew Avenue in Dundalk, Ireland) in Potlatch 2, I noticed that, as soon as I tapped on T.B.A. [described only as "highway=tertiary" and its name], it showed arrows pointing to the right, which at first I thought were one way arrows. I switched to iD - same thing, though here instead of arrows there were just triangles, obviously different from the one way arrows.</p>
<p>Yet, if I add "one_way=no" to T.B.A.,the arrows/triangles dispappear.</p>
<p>Do they have any meaning? Or are they just a minor bug? Or...?</p>

<p>Every way in OSM has a direction. The direction is only relevant if certain tags are present. For example tags such as oneway, maxspeed:forward, maxspeed:backward, cycleway:left, cycleway:right and so on.</p>

<p>I'm aware of THAT; however, these arrows appear without any relevant tags.</p>
<p>I just drew a line with two nodes from left to right, tagged it "highway=residential", and when I then clicked on that line, there were the little arrows pointing towards the right.</p>
<p>Have I simply never noticed them, or are they a helpful new feature of OSM?</p>

<p>There has been a direction arrow in the Potlatch2 tool box for quite a while. In addition to scai's advice it is also useful to know and important when drawing multi polygons such when mapping for water and islands, that the water is on the the left of the way, so you should contain the water in an anti-clockwise polygon, and the island should been drawn clockwise. I have not used iD much so i can't comment on it.</p>

<p>They probably have been there since day 1 in all editors. Because when you want to had the tags that scai mentions, you need to know the direction before the tag is actually set. After all, you have to choose between :forward or :backward based on those arrows.</p>

<p>Strange; I just remembered that some time ago different speed limits for each direction were introduced for a two lane street near my home.</p>
<p>I checked and found the "lanes:..." tags, and, because I saw no obvious way to tell what was "forward" on that street, I temporarily added "oneway=1".</p>
<p>Apparently on my device the arrows were not visible at that time.</p>
<p>However, as they now are, everything is good.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys!</p>
