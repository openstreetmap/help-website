<p>The ultimate source of the red bug icons are people who are using the OSM map data and are finding problems with it. Currently potlatch2 shows bugs from <a href="http://www.mapdust.com/">MapDust</a> although additional bug trackers can be added. Of all the bugs currently in MapDust the vast majority come from people using Skobbler navigation apps on iPhones and Android devices, but there are bugs also from other sources such as the MapQuest "Open" sites like <a href="http://open.mapquest.co.uk/">open.mapquest.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>There is no specific team who deals with them - they are intended as an additional aid to OSM mappers to help improve the map quality. Feel free to investigate and resolve the ones in your area. Think of them as similar to some of the "debug" background layers that we have available in OSM already, and use them to improve the quality of our maps.</p>
<p>Bugs can be closed (or marked as not reproducible) as you see fit. Sometimes I find that a cluster of bugs-without-information draws attention to a particular problem - for example I found a roundabout that needed direction reversing just by finding 5 or 6 bugs beside it, even though each one said nothing helpful. However, due to the large numbers of "useless" bugs, those with only default text will be hidden in the next release of potlatch2, until we find a better way to deal with them.</p>

<p>Re (3) I'd suggest yes, if you want to. A large number of mapdust "bugs" simply don't describe any problem at all. In places that I know well I've "marked as unreproduceable" the ones that don't, where there definitely isn't a problem. Ones that don't describe a problem but where there IS a problem that I know about (e.g. missing roads) I've added a comment to say "mapdust reporter probably mean to say 'X'". Ones that DO describe a problem I've left, even if I don't think that the bug description is correct (in case I'm wrong), unless I've actually checked it.</p>
<p>Re (2) it's entirely up to you. No-one's compelling you to - if you don't find the mapdust information useful (and may people don't) then just ignore it. Whether it is useful or not where you are will depending on the quality of bugs submitted - where I am there's at least one frequent OSM mapper using it and so at least some of the information from Mapdust is useful. For street names etc. I'd only use the description though (what the mapper said) not what Mapdust lists as the "Address".</p>
