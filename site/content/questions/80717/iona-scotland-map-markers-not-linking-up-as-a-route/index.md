In fact, the route shown is on the mainland. It's like nobody has walked the trails between the map markers so the map is suggesting to go back to the mainland by boat, go to another harbour and get a different ferry back to the other parts of the island. We have 8 other trails in Scotland, Ireland and Northern Ireland and they all work fine. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Frederik,</p>
<p>Our developer is having trouble creating the presaved map and is asking the question below:</p>
<p>But we are not getting routing option like Walking, Cycling and Driving in GPX file. SO can you ask to support how to use that type of routing option in GPX.</p>
<p>Can you help?</p>

<p>One more thing worth mentioning - I can't comment on Iona, but some of the things on one of your maps of West Donegal don't seem to be in OSM at all. I'd expect Garvecross Cairn to be around <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/54.71436/-8.73739">https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/54.71436/-8.73739</a> and even when I click "data" to look at things not shown in a particular map style, there's nothing there.</p>
<p>I'd suggest having a chat with the Irish OSM community because (a) they're really friendly and (b) there are a number of folks there that are really interested in this sort of historical stuff. If you go to <a href="https://openstreetmap.community/">https://openstreetmap.community/</a> and zoom in on Ireland you'll see various options - Telegram is probably where most IE people are.</p>

<p>Hi Frederik,</p>
<p>That's exactly what we are trying. We want an admin to be able to add walking routes via the admin, then we want to display those routes on a map.</p>
<p>In the admin, we have a marker drag and drop, this is really the only time that the route needs to be calculated. Based on your comments we are now trying to redo the maps so we are not calling the api each time a map loads on the front end, instead they will call a local GPX file.</p>
<p>We are also using Mapbox, this is the only way my dev couldd work out how to get walking routes to display.</p>
<p>Both myself and my dev are new to OSM.</p>
<p>Are we taking the best approach to achieve this or is there guide documentation to the api we can follow?</p>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, there is no native OpenStreetMap "create a map with routes on it" API. There are third-party services (like <a href="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/">uMap</a> and from Mapbox and others) that may do what you want. If you've solved your problem by using a service from Mapbox - great!</p>

<p>In the admin area we have an area to set where the marker should go, like this:<a href="https://prnt.sc/1dwyrro">https://prnt.sc/1dwyrro</a> Then we have another option so that the markers can be arranged in the correct order to make the route: <a href="https://prnt.sc/1dx08sv">https://prnt.sc/1dx08sv</a> This is how we set the order of markers defining the correct route to take.

<p>This web site is very poorly designed and harmful to OpenStreetMap. Every time anyone visits the web site, or any of the other trail web sites you have created, a routing request is made to the OpenStreetMap routing engine where it uses up OpenStreetMap's donation-financed resources.</p>
<p>If you have 1000 visitors a day, then that's 1000 route requests to OpenStreetMap. If you are featured somewhere in the media and you have a million visitors, that's a million route requests to OpenStreetMap.</p>
<p>All without making <em>any</em> sense at all, because the image you want to serve is <strong>always the same!</strong></p>
<p>What you need to be doing is run these route requests once, save the result as a GeoJSON or KML or CSV file, and then serve that file. That would use zero computing resources on OSM's side. And your site would still work even if OSM is overloaded. Right now, the way you have built this, you have zero control over the paths that are shown; if someone accidentally breaks a path in OSM then it might show a giant deviation, and then someone complains to you and says "your map shows a wrong path", and you want to check it and in the mean time OSM has been fixed again so you don't even know what they saw when they looked at the map. So, any way you look at it, this is badly done - bad for you, and bad for us. Please fix it.</p>
<p>The reason you get the funny results on Iona is most likely the way in which you build your routing request as a round trip between the different points and the fact that you explicitly request "driving" mode, whereas many of the locations are not anywhere near a road that is accessible by motorcar.</p>
<p>I have also noticed that your application uses a "raw" version of OpenLayers that pulls in more than a hundred individual OpenLayers snippets which is also not how this is usually done.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to say this but this nice looking web site is extremely ugly under the hood. If this is the work of a volunteer, let us help you fix it. If this is the work of a paid "professional", then please ask them for your money back and find someone who actually knows what they are doing!</p>

<p>Hi Frederik,</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your helpful comments. Our developers will take them on board, especially running the requests once so as not to overload OSM resources. Unless there's a bug, we have all the routes set to walking as opposed to driving. We're checking that out right now. We'll probably be back with more questions, but we really appreciate your prompt, knowledgeable response. once we've done some work at our side, we'll let you know so you can look it over.</p>

<p>It's probably worth taking a step back and asking what you are actually trying to do?</p>
<p>Also it might make sense for your developer to ask questions themselves rather than have you "interpreting" them here.</p>
<p>A GPX itself is just a flat XML file with some sorts of information in it (which can include routes between points). It makes no sense to calculate these routes on the fly though - presumably you either just want to show a bunch of locations (and let people find their own way along roads and paths that are clearly shown) or you have an idea of how people should go from one to the other, and you could overlay that on your existing Leaflet map.</p>
