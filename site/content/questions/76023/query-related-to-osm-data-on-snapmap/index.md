<p>With any map that uses OSM for some of their data, you'll need to contact them to ask when the data will appear.</p>
<p>Some OSM-based maps use OSM for some things but not others (Facebook is an example of that) and some might take quite a long time to update after new OSM data is available (that used to be the case with Mapbox, not sure if it ia now).</p>

<p>FYI, Mapbox seems to have greatly improved their update frequency. It used to take years for changes to show up, but their preview maps are now showing edits I made as recently as 10 days ago.</p>
