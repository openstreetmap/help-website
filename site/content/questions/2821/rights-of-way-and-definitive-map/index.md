<p>There's been a lot of discussion on the GB mailing lists about this, and the answer (although generally "no") isn't straightforward:</p>
<p>The "definitive map" is usually (always?) based on an underlying OS map and therefore the problem arises "is that a suitable source to derive from?". Probably not - although the rights of way data have of course come from the council in the first place.</p>
<p>However, if you can get hold of a "definitive statement" expressed in terms that don't depend on an OS map, then you may be able to use that - but as with any source of external data check its provenance and accuracy.</p>
<p>A quick web search of: "definitive map" "definitive statement" turns up a few local authorities which might be helpful.</p>
<p>A search of the talk-GB list such as: "definitive statement" <a href="http://site:lists.openstreetmap.org">site:lists.openstreetmap.org</a>/pipermail/talk-gb/ should find previous discussions, including contributions from people who deal with rights of way every day.</p>
<p>Finally, thanks for saying that you're actually walking these paths - as a walker myself knowing that someone has actually been down there and mapped e.g. fences and stiles is far more useful than a line traced from (say) and old NPE map.</p>

<p>The paths can be tagged as highway=footway whether the signs are there or not. If they are signed, it is increasingly common that they are also tagged designation=public_footpath. The wiki is a mess on this topic, but there is a bit on <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Tagging_Guidelines">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Tagging_Guidelines</a> under Copyright Issues which relates.</p>

<p>A good point - I always use "designation" for e.g. public_footpath, restricted_byway etc. It's nicely orthogonal to other access tagging and makes it much easier when looking at a map made from OSM data to work out what's a public footpath and what isn't.</p>

<p>As a general comment, we don't have any right to the information. So saying "the sign had fallen down" is no excuse for copying from a map: it's just tough luck on us.</p>
<p>The correct way is to badger the council into putting the signs back up, or to get the information from them directly with explicit permission to use it in OSM.</p>

<p>perhaps a telephone call or email to the council asking is TL 123456 to TL 234567 a foot path or what ever, should be ok but I'm sure they would refer us to the Definitive Map. I can't help thinking that it like reading a reference book but don't use the info or tell anyone what you've leart</p>
