<p>This should be easy, but it's got me stumped! How does one undo one's saved changes? I was just finishing some changes and suddenly everything went pear-shaped on me: Buildings which I'd identified miraculously moved themselves out of position; and I was unable to activate their borders, or move them back where they belonged.</p>
<p>I figured the best thing to do was delete the changes I'd already made and start over. But—Alas!—I've so far been unable to find a way to undo those changes. How is this done? HELPFUL suggestions will be greatly appreciated on this undo-changes matter. Thank you!</p>

<p>Generally speaking, it isn't always straightforward to undo a saved changeset ("revert" it). There's a summary of the issues on <a href="/questions/731/how-can-i-revert-a-changeset">this previous question</a>.</p>
<p>However, in your case it may be straightforward, since I'm presuming that we're talking about <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/changeset/18923031">this</a> edit, as it wasn't made very long ago, and it's unlikely that anyone has made other changes based on yours. However - looking at it I don't necessarily think that it needs reverting though - just change the shape of the buildings a bit and delete the duplicate nodes?</p>
<p>In the more general case you may often get a quicker response on <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Irc">IRC</a> than the help site.</p>
