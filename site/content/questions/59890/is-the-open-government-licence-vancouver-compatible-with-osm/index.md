<p>I've been looking over the data my city provides under a ostensibly open licence, and realizing how useful much of it is. Reading the licence over it seems plausible that it'd be compatible with our licence.</p>
<p>The licence can be seen <a href="http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx#tab19099">here</a>. And the datasets <a href="http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/index.htm">here</a></p>
<p>Or to save you the trouble of clicking on that, here is the licence in full:</p>
<h2 id="the-open-government-licence-vancouver">The Open Government Licence – Vancouver</h2>
<p>The Open Government Licence – Vancouver is based on version 2.0 of the Open Government Licence – British Columbia, which was developed through public consultation and collaborative efforts by the provincial and federal government. The only substantive change to the licence is references to the Province of British Columbia are replaced with the City of Vancouver.</p>

</ol>
<p>Reading it over I'm feeling pretty optimistic, but is it compatible? They have lots of good stuff that'd improve the map of Vancouver. After appropriate import discussions, of course.</p>

<p>Your first port of call should probably be the talk-ca mailing list, where people are likely to have come across this issue before: <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-ca/">https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-ca/</a></p>
<p>That said, in general, the main issue with this sort of licence is generally whether the data provider is happy that the attribution provided by 'downstream' users of OpenStreetMap is sufficient. It's impractical to ask every user of OSM data to include "© Government of Vancouver" (or whatever) in their on-map credits. Rather, we ask that people link their standard-issue "© OpenStreetMap" credit to <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">osm.org/copyright</a> which, in turn, provides the credits (either directly on that page for the largest datasets, or via a link to a wiki page).</p>
<p>That may not be enough to satisfy the data provider's attribution requirements; all you can do is ask them. Check with talk-ca first to see if anyone has already obtained permission, and if not, the Licensing Working Group can advise you on how best to approach them for permission.</p>

<p>I was hoping that simply crediting them in the edit summary would be sufficient. From your answer I understand that may or may not be enough, and they are under no obligation to clarify that in the licence itself. Do I understand correctly?</p>

<p>A map produced from OSM data, containing the Vancouver data, will usually just be attributed "© OpenStreetMap". Vancouver's clear request above is that "You must... include any attribution statement specified by [the City of Vancouver]". They could well argue that just putting "© OpenStreetMap" doesn't qualify as that. Certainly noting them in the changeset comment ("edit summary") is almost certainly not good enough - at the very least they'd expect a mention on <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contributors,">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contributors,</a> and in fact their name is already there, which suggests this might already have been cleared. Like I say, go talk to talk-ca.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link Richard, I will point out that there's a minor typo in it, a trailing comma, which breaks the link. <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contributors#Vancouver">Here</a> is a link that should work, directly to the Vancouver section.</p>
