<p>So we all know that OSQA is probably broken beyond repair... and I got a meta problem here in OSQAs convert handling.</p>
<p>I just tried to convert an answer to a comment here in this thread: <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/85038/hierarchie-von-ortsnamen">https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/85038/hierarchie-von-ortsnamen</a> . The answer by altesCoon that I tried to convert had a comment by Discostu.</p>
<p>OSQA for some reason did not convert the answer to a comment but moved the comment by Discostu from answer to the other. If anyone has an idea how to fix this, please help. And sorry for the confusion, I now learned that some things in OSQA do not work as expected.</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce the OSQA behavior: use the "more" -&gt; "convert answer to comment" on altesCoons answer and choose the answer by Discostu as target.</p>
