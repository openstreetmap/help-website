(It does on Mavericks GM; that might be new in Mavericks, however.) It might be asking you to choose an application to use as an X11 server, in which case you should look for the Xquartz server and, if it's not in the list, use the "Browse" button (which is also in the Mavericks dialog, but might not be in the Mountain Lion dialog).</p></div><div id="comment-25852-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(09 Oct '13, 15:05)</span> Guy Harris ♦♦</div></div><span id="25893"></span><div id="comment-25893" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-25893-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>We're making progress!</p><p>Yes, the window displays, "Where is X11?" and I had to browse to Applications/Utilities in order to select XQuartz.</p><p>Now, when I select Wireshark from Applications, XQuartz is launched and a terminal window is opened.
