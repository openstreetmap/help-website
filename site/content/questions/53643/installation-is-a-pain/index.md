After a reboot, I am able to uninstall wireshark, but then WinPcap unstall hangs, the progress bar is not making progress, and it says output folder c:\Windows\system32, not sure what the program wants to output there, I think it should remove files instead. It keeps me busy for more than an hour now. By the way I tried to post a message here two times but it failed because first time I needed to validate my email, second time because the website stopped responding.
