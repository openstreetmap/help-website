<p>A while ago, I would look at the osm wiki and fix the tagging mistakes. Apparently you should not do this, and I had all the edits on the account for that reverted and my account blocked. (I will also mention the iD fix thing that was the final straw for the revert and block). I don't fully agree with the revert, but rules are rules. Luckily, on that account I got the block undone almost immediately after I assured them that I would not do so. But the tagging mistake building=yesq always stood out to me. This is clearly a mistake that comes from typing building=yes and trying to square the corners using the q button. Can I fix this tag without getting my account blocked again?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, that is indeed what it looks like, and yes, changing "yesq" to "yes" and squaring the building (and checking that it broadly corresponds to aerial imagery and isn't just a doodle) would make perfect sense.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. To be clear, your previous account block was <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user_blocks/6844">here</a> and was revoked immediately you contacted us.</p>
