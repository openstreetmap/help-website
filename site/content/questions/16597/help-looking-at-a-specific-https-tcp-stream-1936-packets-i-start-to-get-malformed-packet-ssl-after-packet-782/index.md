Only thing we could do until now is to exclude the Sending side and the network Probe connected inline to be the culprit. The Receiver side seems to be OK too. It is as if something on the wire is starting to force TCP/IP congestion handling to be overall brutal in dealing with the traffic.</p><p>What has been observed so far is that the TCP Window is filled up pretty fast, but is not reduced until after some time. We see most ACK's (up to 100) for SEQ #1 and the gradually it goes down until the windows size is adapted to the network speed. The fact that several TCP Window Full messages show up tends to pioint into a dynamic rerouting into network of different speed to happen during the entire conversation. Could that be the case ? Measurements have pointed this to happen mainly on g3 initiated connections. Manually reducing the speed (traffic shaper) did not really bring any conclusive answer/hint.</p><p>However - even if this is the the case - why would we all of a sudden have so many problems decrypting the traffic in a Monitoring env. using a MiMa method with private key etc. ? We are using a probe that relies on the OSI application layer, and requiring the HTTP code to be decrypted correctly so that it can be analyzed for errors (It's quality/SLA Monitoring done here, not security)</p><p>Any hints ? What to check for ? we'd really only like to understand why it is happening...

If it is a link aggregation TAP (meaning that it outputs RX/TX on one single port to the tshark PC) you may encounter one of the frequent problems with link aggregation TAPs. I have plenty of cases where those TAPs got me or someone else in trouble, for example when it did not deliver packets that were really on the link (which had a 10% load, so no buffering should occur), resulting in missing packets in the trace file. Other cases include inducing CRC errors to a connection between a Cisco switch and a router that were gone as soon as we removed the TAP. Both cases happened with major vendor devices, so they were no cheap knockoff but worth a four digit number of dollars each.</p><p>Personally, I only use full duplex TAPs to avoid that kind of trouble, since it is annoying to be unsure if the TAP worked correctly or not, and in case of link aggregation TAPs I had too many bad experiences.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>05 Dec '12, 08:34</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c578ba2967741f25aebd6afef702f432?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Jasper&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>Jasper ♦♦</span><br />

IMHO - it's in the PATH from the Server to the client that something is slowing things down that much. Can that be ?
