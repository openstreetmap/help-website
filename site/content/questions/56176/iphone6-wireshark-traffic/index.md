I had the IPhone 6 owner browse to the Internet, and he could successfully connect to Google. This should have sent out some packets of his IPhone 6 to get Google's website. Is there anything I need to do in Wireshark or possibly in the router to see his traffic through Wireshark? Or is it simply not possible to capture IPhone 6 traffic through Wireshark?

Depending on what you are trying to do will determine what you need here. If at all possible, I try to get wired traffic. However, not all problems are solvable with this data. It all depends.</p><p>Some links to get you started:</p><p><a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup">https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup</a></p><p>especially these two links at the bottom:</p><p>Capturing on Ethernet Networks Capturing on 802.11 Wireless Networks</p><p>If you are just starting out and 'playing', I would try to get some sort of tap or switch with mirror port and play with wired traffic for a while. Your IP filter would then work. When you are comfortable here, move to wireless. That is much more difficult and complex, but it is a natural progression.</p><p>The cheapest mirror port switch I have found is something like this:</p><p>tp-link sg105e NETGEAR ProSAFE GS105Ev2 <a href="https://routerboard.com/RB941-2nD-TC">https://routerboard.com/RB941-2nD-TC</a></p><p>On Amazon here in the US these can be had from $US 25-40. Well worth it for mirror port functionality.<br />
