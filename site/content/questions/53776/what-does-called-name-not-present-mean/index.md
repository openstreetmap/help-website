We don't use any user names; the files go to each user's fully shared folder on the server. So, what "Called name" is it looking for? A device name? Is it NOW looking for a user name? An old girlfriend's name?

The questions and answers on this Q&amp;A site are intended to serve as a knowledge base for Wireshark users in using Wireshark and solving networking problems. The stated problem here is an application problem between (proprietary) Ricoh equipment and unknown client software. These fall outside of the scope of this Q&amp;A site IMHO.</p></div><div id="comment-53838-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(05 Jul '16, 08:24)</span> Jaap ♦</div></div><span id="53841"></span><div id="comment-53841" class="comment"><div id="post-53841-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>@jbruyet, as you haven't provided a link to a capture file (not a screenshot) documenting the error, we cannot even say whether the protocol the Ricoh box uses to deliver the scans is proprietary or not.

One of the errors is "Called name not present". A later comment says this means that "[the] called name does not exist on [the] remote node". The architecture of NetBIOS-over-TCP is documented in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1001">RFC 1001</a>; it explains that, for the NetBIOS Session Service, when a client connects to a server, it provides its own NetBIOS name as the "calling name" and the NetBIOS name of the remote host and service as the "called name". The error means that the "called name" in question isn't known to the server; NetBIOS host names, by convention, have 15 characters of host name and one character indicating a service, so either it's the wrong host name or the service in question isn't supported on the server. It's not a user name, and it's not a device name.</p><p>We'd have to see name in question - all 16 characters, the last of which might not be a printable character, so we'd need its value as two hex digits as well - in order to determine anything more. But before you ask us anything more, you might want to make sure that 1) the SMB file server is running on the machine in question <em>and</em> is supporting NetBIOS-over-TCP, not just SMB-over-TCP (Microsoft might either have made NetBIOS-over-TCP not supported by default, or not supported at all, in more recent versions of Windows; I don't know whether Samba or Apple's SMBX server have done the same) and 2) the copier thinks the server's NetBIOS name is the NetBIOS name the server actually uses.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>05 Jul '16, 11:14</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f93de7000747ab5efb5acd3034b2ebd7?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Guy%20Harris&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Guy Harris ♦♦<br />
