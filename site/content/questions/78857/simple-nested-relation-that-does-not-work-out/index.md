<p>The Glenmarie Golf and Country Club at 3.0969, 101.5732 consist of 2 courses of 18 holes each. They are the Garden Course and The Valley Course. The former is simple enough, 18 holes within one area. The latter is split into 2 portions by a highway. This is where the fun comes in. I mapped the Valley Course as 2 polygons both with 2 outer roles. If there were no split, the whole course can be mapped as a normal area with 2 holes relation which I had encountered at 3.0891, 101.5971. No issues there. At Glenmarie, looks like my first foray into relation within a relation did not work. The warnings given by JOSM is just too cryptic to me. I just could not work them out. I must admit that I maps while glancing at AO live tennis on TV, but that help to keep me going.</p>
