<p>meta: I suggest to ask the JOSM Java version problem in a new question and to focus here on the "move up to JOSM from iD" as both are different issues. The Java problem is only relevant for a specific group of people but not all who might be interested in the iD vs. JOSM question.</p>

<p>Your question might involve some personal opinion controversy as everybody has their own preferences and viewpoints about <span>editors</span>. Some people might say: directly from the start. Some others: never. I think it depends on the user, what he knows already, which other programs he is used to, his attitude, …</p>
<p>I am trying to include as few as possible personal opinion: You "should move up" from <span>iD</span> when you think/feel that the <span>JOSM</span> benefits could enhance your mapping and when you feel committed enough that a short-term learning phase with a lower productivity would pay-off in later weeks of more productive mapping. See this older question for <a href="/questions/34749/">what-are-the-main-things-that-im-missing-out-by-using-the-id-editor</a> (regarding "iD does everything you may need to do").</p>

<p>I would say that after you understand the basic concepts of how OSM works, you're ready to "graduate" to <span>JOSM</span>. JOSM is a much more complex tool than <span>PL2</span> or <span>iD</span>, and also much more powerful, even without taking into account its extensibility.</p>
<p>However, it also assumes that the user knows what is being done, and is not as user-friendly as the other <span>editors</span> - potential for severe errors and damage to the data is amplified when using powerful tools.</p>
<p>When I did "the jump" to JOSM after only a few week working with OSM, I was careful to learn where the tools that did everything that PL2 did before, and careful to see if any mistakes were made - some things work very differently between JOSM and PL2 - for a few weeks more, while I was getting used to it. In the end, the keyboard shortcuts became second nature to me, and I never used another editor since then (I completed 2 years of OSM activity yesterday!).</p>
<p>About the need for the JRE7 for the newer releases of JOSM, if you REALLY cannot upgrade to the JRE7, use the last version that supports JRE6 (version 6502?).</p>

<p>I'd say as soon as you need to edit relations, or work offline. iD does neither well.</p>
<p>If you always have a network connection, and you're sticking to points, lines and polygons, iD will do you.</p>
