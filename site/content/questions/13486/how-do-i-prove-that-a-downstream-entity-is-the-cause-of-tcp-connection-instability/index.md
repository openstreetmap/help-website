We have a SMPP client on some our server and it is connecting to an SMSC. They chat backwards and forwards using SMPP which is just a protocol over TCP. Everything was working great until 1 August 2012 (very strange date for things to suddenly go pear shape).</p><p>One of the SMSCs that we connect to suddenly started exihibiting the worst connection stability. All the other SMSCs that we connect to have been perfect. We can maintain the connection for hours on end. This one SMSC drops the connection every couple of seconds.</p><p>We have run many many traces looking at the SMPP protocol and I am pretty sure that there is nothing wrong that we are doing according to the SMPP spec (that and every other SMSC is stable). So I was reading wireshark forums etc and came across looking at the connection RST. When I run a wireshark trace against their IP address and run "Expert Infos" the log is full of them. Their IP is mostly the source. Occassionally we are the source but that is due to the fact that they have not answered keep alive packets. I also see a lot of TCP DUP ack (which I believe is a good indicator of packet loss). The connection also appears to be very unstable when we put them under load. During low traffic it seems to be fine except for our receivers that reset the binds every now and then due to the SMSC not acknowledging SMPP keep alive packets.</p><p>Is there anybody here that can confirm my suspicions and look at this trace and tell me what they think.</p><p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5811253/VC_00001_20120809093402.rar">Here is the trace</a></p><p>Sorry, just to add, from previous questions that I have read the contributors always mention that it would be nice to get the developers input. We are the developers of the SMPP software. We can answer all those questions. Any questions you have we will be able to answer. For example the cause of the TCP resets from us is that the keep alive packets are not answered within 30 seconds so we assume a dead connection and restart.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">disconnect tcp</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>09 Aug '12, 00:52</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b7760b5831b2deaeaee8daa8aa62a39e?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="uriDium&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>uriDium<br />

It is so strange. This pretty much started at exactly 09:00Am 1 August. We have called in our hosting infastructure and they deny changing anything.

We need a little more help: I recall the SMSC accusing the wireshark of containing a lot of "Header checksum: 0x0000 [incorrect, should be 0x7b67 (may be caused by "IP checksum offload"?)]" warnings. We read however that may be caused by the NIC not having completed the checksum calculations yet. Some other forums had question relating to packet loss and dropped connections suggested that they disable checksum offloading on the NICs. These seemed to help some guys.

By "the problem is within your application" I mean, the receiving application (or OS) on 196.11.146.34 (or the NATed device behind that IP) does not handle the packets in a propper way. So, if that is <strong>your</strong> system then it is your problem. If that is <strong>their</strong> system/application, it is their problem.</p></div><div id="comment-13503-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(09 Aug '12, 03:26)</span> Kurt Knochner ♦</div></div><span id="13510"></span><div id="comment-13510" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-13510-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Yip, that IP is theirs.
