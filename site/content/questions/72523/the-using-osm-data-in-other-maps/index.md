<p>In general an extract of OSM data is not a produced work and needs to be attributed correctly as describe here <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright</a> and you can only use it and distribute it on ODbL terms. A non-database rendering of such data would be a produced work (however there are obvious limits to the usefulness of that) which requires attribution, but otherwise leaves a large degree of freedom in how you can licence the work.</p>
<p>Note: in general third party map providers (yandex, google) etc. have restrictive terms that you will not be able to satisfy by using OSM data (essentially it typically boils down to you giving them unrestricted commercial exploitation rights to the contents, which you cannot do).</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your comment, we really would like to deal with this situation in order to understand how possible using OSM data in other maps, I think it will also be very useful for other OSM users. So now I will try to reflect in more detail and specifically what we are going to do and our questions. If we collect data from your API in XML format or perhaps directly from the front of the API in JSON format (is there any difference in this situation?). The final format for displaying data is the pins of organizations in the custom (our) design, which we place on a third-party map, with the ability to do so under license. Users can find out what type of organization and what kind of organization, filter organizations on the map, i.e., for example, view only hospitals. We assume to take and reflect on the map only socially significant objects on the map - schools, kindergartens, sports institutions, hospitals and shops (a fairly small number of objects). Is this obvious limits to the usefulness, as you wrote?</p>

<p>Сontinuation. If we allow to use the specified data on our site, which we put on a map, and under the terms of the purpose is not to extract the data, but only for the user to see these data, i.e. the goal is to bring it to the end user as shown in the example with Garmin maps on the site at the link <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Data_License/Produced_Work_-_Guideline">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Data_License/Produced_Work_-_Guideline</a> and it says it's Produced Work. You write that almost any extraction is not Produced Work, you could not explain on the basis of what such a conclusion is made, if possible? And I would like to clarify about attribution. The guideline states that we should indicate that we are contributors and provide a link to distribution under the ODbL license, on the other hand, for Produced Work in clause 4.3. license ODbL is written a little differently and that is not consistent with the logic written in guidline. Based on this, the question arises whether it is enough that we specify that the map simply contains information from the OSM as indicated at the beginning of paragraph 4.3?</p>
