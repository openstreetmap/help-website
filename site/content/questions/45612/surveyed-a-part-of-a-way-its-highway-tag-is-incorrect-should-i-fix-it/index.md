<p>Suppose there is a way of a few kilometers length, marked <code>highway=path</code>. I started traveling along it; discovered that it should have better been marked <code>highway=track</code> instead. Since it didn't match my expectations, I retraced my steps back.</p>
<p>What should I have done in this situation?</p>
<ol>
<li>Fix the tag to <code>highway=track</code></li>
<li>Split the way up to the point I have visited; fix the tag for that part to <code>highway=track</code></li>
<li>Don't bother; leave it as it is</li>
</ol>
<p>I chose (3) at that time. But what is the right choice? Also, whatever I do, should I add a "fixme" tag describing the situation?</p>
<p>Just to make it clear: this way has no intersections; it connects to other ways only at the beginning and end. So if it looks like a "track" at one end, it's probably the same at the other end.</p>

<p>Just to add a fourth possibility - you've also got the option to ask the original mapper about the "path vs track" question. The easiest way to do this is probably via a comment in the discussion on the original changeset. Obviously it helps to ask a polite question rather than just bluntly say "I think you mapped it wrong", but the only way to find out if there's a valid reason for it being mapped as it is is to ask.</p>

<p>I would do 2. Perhaps even 1 when the aerial images show evidence that the complete road is a track. 3 is the worst solution IMHO. If everybody would do this, nothing will ever be updated, not ? So please split the way and mark the part you did as track.</p>

<p>I'd probably do (2) as well, and I'd also add a fixme to the remaining part of the way, perhaps explaining what you know - that you surveyed one end of it, and that was a track rather than a path, and that you think the rest of it might be too.</p>

<p>As SomeoneElse, but I might add a note ( <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Notes#Adding_notes">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Notes#Adding_notes</a> ) rather than (or maybe as well as) a fixme, as the notes are generally more visible.</p>
