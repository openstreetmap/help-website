<p>I don't think the mapnik team is currently occupying themselves with icon creation, but you can always create your own icons and ask the team to use them. The entire process on how to do it (the standards and who to contact) is described in the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Icons">wiki</a>.</p>
<p>As with so many open-source stuff. If you don't do it yourself, you can't count on others to do it, you can only be happy if they do it.</p>

<p>But to be honest, it's unsure whether icons will find their way into the default style even if you create them yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintenance of the default Mapnik style is currently lagging behind, there are many unresolved issues.</li>
<li>The style maintainers do not include any feature that can be mapped in OSM into the style, and their criteria for inclusion are highly subjective.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can still try and many of us would be happy about new icons, but I think it's fair to warn you that there is no guarantee that icons will be added to a map unless you render it yourself.</p>
