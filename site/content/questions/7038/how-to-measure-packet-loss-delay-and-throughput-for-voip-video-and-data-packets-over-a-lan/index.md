(because the data and video packets are both TCP) and wot im supposed to do is video streaming.. found the option of tcp stream graph in the statistics menu from which we can get graphs for throughput, RTT etc. is RTT and delay the same thing? for measuring the throughput of a connection (A to B or B to A) how exactly shud we proceed? like, wen to start and stop the capture or which packets to chose? im getting graphs for throughput, RTT and all but jus not sure if those are the ones i want.. hv to measure values of those qos parameters for different cases like video + data packets, data + voip, video + voip and all of them together..should we take the readings from the wireshark in the server or from the clients in the LAN.. hv got wireshark installed in all the systems..</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">delay loss lan throughput qos</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>22 Oct '11, 00:10</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/45166a5df521f83b8cdc4fcb4342f98b?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Arun%20Kripal&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Arun Kripal<br />
