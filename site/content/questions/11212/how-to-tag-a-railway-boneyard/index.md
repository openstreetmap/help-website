<p>I have a question about the location of old tramway cars:</p>
<p>In Tbilisi, a group of private people have saved an old tramway car from scrapping, it is now standing on a private property waiting restoration. How can I tag these?</p>
<p>It is not a museum, as there are no opening hours. Anyway, it is possible to visit them, as the area is not fenced in. And they are interesting landmarks and potential attractions for railway buffs.</p>
<p>I was thinking about historic = * But I don't know any further. But there are no tracks, so it is not qualified as a railway=preserved or abandoned.</p>
<p>Every input appreciated.</p>
<p>BTW, I was searching the tram car several times, and I am happy to finally found it and being able to take some photos. I want to save the hassle to fellow interested people :)</p>

<p>Well, there is no clear tagging convention for such objects and I would suggest you to contact our mailing list dedicated to tagging discussions : <a href="http://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/tagging">tagging@openstreetmap.org</a>.<br />
Anyway, you could check the possibility to use the tag "<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:tourism">tourism=attraction</a>" combined with a possible new "<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:historic">historic</a>" tag e.g. "historic=tram" for the vehicle itself (until a museum is created or the vehicle is restored and runs again in which case I wouldn't tag the vehicle itself anymore but its touristic line).</p>

<p>Ruins are the remains of man-made architecture. Not something about vehicles, even if they look like ruins ;) And don't use innappropriate tags just to see an icon on the slippy map. That would be 'tagging for the renderer'. But why not "historic=tram" or "historic=tram_vehicle" or "historic=vehicle" + "tram=yes" ? Again, you should discuss on the tagging mailing list.</p>
