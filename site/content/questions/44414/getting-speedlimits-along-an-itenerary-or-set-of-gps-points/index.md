<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am building an App using Python to compute a speed profile (using speedlimits) between two adresses or two coordinates. My final goal is to determine my car consumption for a giving itenerary. For that, my consumption model needs the travelling distance and the maximum speed my vehicle is reaching. Since I won't always have a GPS recording, I was thinking I could use the speedlimits as targets for my vehicle (of course if we respect the speedlimits ^^). I am sure it is feasible because it is almost what Google map would do to compute the traveling time.</p>
<p>Any idea how I could script that or maybe use some tools (free of course ^^)?</p>
<p>Thank you all.</p>
