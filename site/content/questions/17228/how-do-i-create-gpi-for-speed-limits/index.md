<p>Do you really need to create a node POI ? As in, is the Garmin software unable to make use of the information on a way and need the information to be provided on a node instead ? That seems unlikely to me, because a speed limit realy only has meaning on a way, not on a node. Also, how do you distinguish which side of the node the speed limit applies to ?</p>
