<p>I am expanding housing detail around my area and after surveying a local road there a group of 5 houses which have sequential numbers that are not part of the road numbering as they are part of their own 'estate'.</p>
<p>Houses in question (currently a single building which i will fix) are/is <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/198856608.">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/198856608.</a> Address's are 1-5, Ashtree Court, Hopewell Drive. Adding a number and the Road name is simple enough but i cant see how to add the 'Ashtree Court'.</p>
<p>How do i add address detail to these?</p>
