<p>For your first point, you could ask the makers of MotionX to support direct uploading to OSM. There's nothing that we can do, within the OSM Community, to enhance their application for them.</p>
<p>With regards to the photos, you'll have to find out where the photos are, and whether they are available in some useful format or not, before we can give you any suggestions. Again, it might be worth asking the MotionX guys about this.</p>

<p>Thanks, Andy. I appreciate your willingness to help, however my question was more to the users of MotionX. By asking the question, I am trying to "find out where the photos are, and whether they are available in some useful format or not" - as you suggest. I don't know who "MotionX guys" are, I am not as engaged in their community, if they have any, as I am trying to be here, so I'm bringing my questions here.</p>
<p>And to my first question, I know I could have asked it more specifically, but can I upload tracks to OSM via e-mail? That would constitute streamlining to me.</p>
