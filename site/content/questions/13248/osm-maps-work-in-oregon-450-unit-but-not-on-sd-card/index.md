<p>I downloaded OSM maps. The gmapsupp.img file works in the Oregon 450 main unit, I can rename it and it still works, but when I put the .img onto an uSD card (into the Garmin directory) it does not show up in settings - maps - mapinfo. I tried 2 different cards, and 8GB card and a 2GB card. What am I missing? Garmin Support is of no help since these are not their maps - they claim alternate-source maps may not work in the SD card though they may work in the Oregon. I'm sure this works for others - what am missing?</p>
<p>I also added a Birdseye folder under Garmin on the SD card and moved the .jnx file there. They no longer show up in setup-maps. I am wondering if there is some additional file generated in the SD root perhaps. I have read that on an 800 you need to make the SD card recordable and start/stop a timer but that's not something that translates into Oregon-ese</p>
<p>Is there perhaps an autorun.inf that needs to be present?</p>
<p>BTW I have used simple windows copy to get maps onto the SD card, I have also used mapsource to generate a gmapsupp.img and used it to transfer to SD card. The transfer worked just fine but the maps do not show up. Unfortunately the maps I won for a nuvi will not authenticate on the Oregon.</p>
<p>P.S. Spent some more quality time with Garmin Support. It is still not working. I even used their mapinstall and transferred OSM maps to "Garmin 450 + SD Card". Note that the SD card is not listed as a separate device... anyway it listed the OSM maps I had, showed the available space that clearly was the internal memory as well as the 8G SD card, built files and transferred those to the SD card into a Garmin directory. Unfortunately they still don't show in mapinfo! Garmin is totally reluctant to talk about 3rd-party maps. I am now wondering whether they boobytrapped their latest device software, I have 5.5 installed. I've also come to the conclusion that the manual is so void of useful information deliberately, so they can't be held to anything...</p>
<p>Regards, Rich</p>

<p>Rich,</p>
<p>I have the same issue. One difference is i have a 4 GB sd card, not 8 GB. Also, i'm running linux on my desktop. I can see the sd card has 1 partition formatted as FAT32. In here i have 1 folder called "Garmin". I've also tried the name "Map". And in this folder i have one file called gmapsupp.img. In the setup map menu of the unit, i expect to see an additional map to enable, but i do not.</p>
<p>Have you had any luck since your last post?</p>

<p>OK, i figured a solution to my situation on Linux. Something similar may work for you.</p>
<p>On Linux the SD card appears as device file /dev/mmcblk0 and partition 1 appears as /dev/mmcblk0p1. The first partition has a FAT32 filesystem. When i install the Garmin folder containing gmapsupp.img here, the GPS unit does not see the map.</p>
<p>I ran fdisk and deleted the first partition. Then i formatted the entire sd card as a FAT32 filesystem, using mkfs.vfat. In other words there is no partition table. I mounted that filesystem, create the Garmin folder, and copied gmapsupp.img there. The GPS unit did see the map and it works.</p>
<p>You may have read on the Internet to create other files in the Garmin folder. IIRC, one was called garmindevice.xml. That's not needed. All i have is 1 sd card, no partition table, 1 fat32 filesystem, one Garmin folder and one gmapsupp.img file.</p>
<p>I got my image file from <a href="http://daveh.dev.openstreetmap.org/garmin/Lambertus/2012-11-15/kml/kml.html">http://daveh.dev.openstreetmap.org/garmin/Lambertus/2012-11-15/kml/kml.html</a></p>

<p>I'm probably way off here, but on the newer Nüvis the <code>gmapsupp.img</code> files have to go in a <code>/Map</code> directory. The <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Garmin#N.C3.BCvi_series">Garmin wiki page</a> has some notes...</p>
