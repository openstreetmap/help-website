Keep in mind that WiFi cards are half duplex, and when capturing you will only be able to read packets from the air, not send anything. AirPCAP does not behave like a normal WiFi card, it is record only - unless using the injection feature, which I haven't used so far.</p><p>My approach would be to use the dedicated AP, have the mobile devices connect to it, and then capture their traffic on the wired connection to the university network by SPAN/TAP.</p></div><div id="comment-31385-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(02 Apr '14, 05:48)</span> Jasper ♦♦</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-31382" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-31382-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
