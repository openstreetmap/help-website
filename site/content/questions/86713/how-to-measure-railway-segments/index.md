<p>Hello, I am looking for a way how to get data for many railway stations like number of tracks and its lengths (measured between switches).</p>
<p>I can manually find each switch in the map and measure distance between them and see the precision is enough for me. Can this process be automated?</p>
<p>I know how to calculate distance between coordinates, so If I can fetch coordinates of all switches and which are directly connected by railroad, I know how to do the rest.</p>
<p>Do you have ideas how to do this things? Thank you.</p>
