Maybe an experience mapper can have a look why there are now so many NR all over the map. The Grand Teton NP below don't show this NR over the map.</p>

<p>Are you sure that they weren't there before? The <em>NR</em> stands for <em>nature reserve</em> and comes from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/relation/1453306">this relation</a>.</p>

<p>Why is it so complicated? I can't find the icon where I have to click on to set both to National Park, because both: leisure = park and leisure = nature_reserve are wrong. Both are National Parks.</p>

<p>Icons which you can click in some editors are just representing a specific tag (or maybe a set of tags). Editors can never supply icons for <span>all tags</span>.

<p>I still don't understand this. If I mark a region in Potlatch 2 I can tag the area as Nation Park. Why can't I do this with Yellowstone and Grand Tetons? It must be possible to change Yellowstone from nature_reserve to National park or not?</p>

<p>Why has just nature reserve a NR all over the map and not the other tags? It looks very disturbing if you want to see the map. This is already a reason to change it.</p>

<p>You can in Potlatch2, but it is harder than usual because those parks are mapped as "<span>relation</span>" (please read). Please also take care when changing the tagging of such big, likely often looked-at objects. You mention "to National park" – well, what is that? What is the tag? As said: this discussion is misplaced here (the system here is not meant for such a discussion) and you really could be helped better in the chat or forum.</p>

<p>How to tag US national parks has been discussed on mailing lists in the past - I'd definitely read that (and dicuss with the wider US community) before diving in and changing the tagging. Specifically, they're not at all "parks" in the English sense (that's why leisure=park was removed from some a couple of years ago).</p>
<p>I'd definitely introduce yourself over on the talk-us mailing list</p>
<p><a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-us">https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-us</a></p>
<p>and raise the issue of how best to tag them there.</p>
