<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am new to OSM. let me explain what I need and have tried and see what solutions are out there.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Download large area as Vector:</strong> Downloading city map with Maperitive is fine. But when you want to download a large area of a province or country (slightly zoomed out) it can never download the OSM data or download as a vector. How can I get a vector of a province or country? Because now when I try it says the area is too big because I guess it is stil trying to download the roads/ small details when you are zoomed in - which I don't need.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Render with a tool/ without knowing codes</strong>: How can I render a map so it is my own design? I would like to make a few small changes to the OSM/Google/Mapbox design so it is my own. However all the Rendering help is jibberish to me - is there a tool to create this based on pre-set options? Could I export Mapbox settings/ design?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>"all the Rendering help is jibberish to me - is there a tool to create this based on pre-set options" - there are many tools available, but most are complex, because map rendering is a complex topic. You'll probably have to dive in somewhere.</p>

<p>You have essentially two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn how to do it yourself</li>
<li>Pay someone to do it for you.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don't think that you will be able to do (1) yourself, that leaves you with (2). There's a list of possible providers <a href="https://switch2osm.org/providers/">here</a>, and I'm sure that there are other lists in our wiki.</p>
<p>You'll be able to discuss with them in detail what you want (and you'll probably need to explain what you mean by "a vector" above), and they'll be able to do it for you.</p>

<p>How can I do it then?</p>
<p>I use OSM downloaded data with Maperitive for maping vector maps of a small area, e.g. a city. But when you try to download OSM data for a large area using OSM/Maperitive it just jams as the area is too big.</p>
<p>So which program is best do do this for larger areas?</p>
