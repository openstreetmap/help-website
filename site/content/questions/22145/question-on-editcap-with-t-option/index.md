I just 'enjoy' working with Wireshark and I'm glad to be able to share my humble knowledge and to extend it. In the past I learned the most about products and/or technologies while I was active in a forum and was 'forced' to think about the problems of other people.</p><blockquote><p>And, I think this is a common thing for all of us: it seems nobody gets past 15% accept rate in the long run. Sad but true.</p></blockquote><p>That's because almost all users on this site are one-time users. They register, ask a question and never come back. Only about 50 users are active on a regular base, which is a surprisingly low number for a tool like Wireshark. I don't understand this either, especially if you look at stackoverflow.
