<p>How do you tag a gully left by what, according to the topo maps, up until a few years ago used to be a creek?</p>
<p>The official name of the feature is Hicks Canyon Wash. It is tree-lined, has a few foot bridges, is impassable to vehicular traffic and serves as a natural boundary of an area of the city. In other words, it's a pretty significant local feature, but to tag it a stream would be a misnomer.</p>
<p>I know there is an intermittent=yes tag and I have, indeed, seen puddles at the bottom of the gully after major storms, but I'm not sure if renderers or anyone else would pay attention. Right now, it shows as a blue line on Mapnik map (tagged waterway=stream, intermittent=yes), but on Google Map, if that's any kind of reference, it's missing, while other streams in the area are shown - even tiny ones, as long as they are "wet".</p>
<p>I tend to agree with Google that it should not be blue, and I also know that we don't tag for the renderer. So, what's the answer? I guess I could just delete it, but I was planning on using it in a boundary relation, because that would be a pretty accurate representation of the physical world, and that's what OSM is all about. Right?</p>

<p>I think <code>tagged waterway=stream, intermittent=yes</code> is actually appropriate here.</p>
<p>To address your qualms about using these tags:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, it's a pretty significant local feature, but to tag it a stream would be a misnomer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are not tagging it as just a stream, but as an intermittent stream, which is different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know there is an intermittent=yes tag [...] but I'm not sure if renderers or anyone else would pay attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you correctly point out, that's not your problem, as you are not supposed to tag for the renderer. At least the main map at <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">https://www.openstreetmap.org/</a> (i.e. openstreetmap-carto plus Mapnik) now supports <code>intermittent=yes</code>, and renders it as a dashed blue line (<a href="https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/805">bug 805</a>, fixed in 2015).</p>
<p>At any rate, the distinction between "intermittent stream" and "permanently dry" is somewhat arbitrary - even regular streets can become streams if there is enough rain :-). So I don't see a problem with using <code>intermittent=yes</code> even if the stream bed is almost always dry.</p>

<p>I like your answer. I don't think Mapnik made my intermittent=yes stream any less blue than a normal stream, but that's a problem (if that's a problem), that probably should be addressed.</p>
<p>I wonder if your answer would be any different if I had asked how to tag a gully. I did not even know what a gully was until I looked up "ravine" and found that it's smaller than a canyon and bigger than a gully. Then I looked up "gully" and from description and pictures knew that that's exactly what Hicks Canyon Wash has become. Are we maybe looking at a new natural tag? It's got fell, scree, heath, etc.</p>

<p>According to the wiki, intermittent streams are rendered with a dotted/dashed blue line, and that's how other maps normally show them. I haven't been able to find any intermittent streams yet, so can't confirm that. Maybe try it and see.</p>

<p>There are several intermittent streams in areas I've mapped and the default renderer at <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">http://www.openstreetmap.org</a> ignores the intermittent tag. Makes the map look much wetter in than it really is. The rendering I setup for generating some maps in those same areas use the USGS typical dashed, dotted format, so I know its possible to get Mapnik to do it.</p>

<p>Currently this is rendered correctly in Mapnik as a dotted blue line, though it doesn't display any naming. Unfortunately some renderers don't seem to recognize this tag at all - e.g. Mapquest, which won't display waterways tagged this way.</p>

<p>I actually go the other way, tagging ephemeral riverbeds with waterway=stream/river, intermittent=yes, seasonal=no - I'm not sure what waterway=wadi adds to this. It's annoying to see Mapnik display areas of desert as if they are covered in rivers, but that's a rendering problem - the Humanitarian layer does a better job with intermittent=yes waterways, presumably because of the areas of the globe they're interested in. The help pages are probably not a good place for a debate - I would recommend the tagging mailing list mentioned by user stf above, under the title "waterway=wadi problem"</p>

<p>I would go with waterway=wadi because it is dry most of the time and only flowing with heavy rains. There is a note with this that states that it is also known as a wash in the deserts of America. At present adding intermittent=yes does not change the line on the map and it still shows as a solid line. waterway=wadi does give a pecked line indicating that it does not have flowing water all the time. I am attempting to get this changed to waterway=river-perennial / stream-perennial which has water all year round and is depicted by a solid blue line, next is waterway=river-nonperennial / stream-nonperennial which has water some of the year and is depicted with a pecked blue line, lastly is waterway=wadi which may only occasionally have water in very heavy rains and depicted with a brown pecked line. This may not happen but I am trying.</p>

<p>While there has been talk of deprecating the tag Waterway=wadi I am against this. The word wadi is putting people off using this tag and maybe the wording should be changed to waterway=dry_river which would then be far more acceptable to more people. Intermittent is usually accepted as being a stream but can be dry during some parts of the year. A wadi is dry most of the time, even years before a sufficiently heavy downpour will turn it into a flowing waterway that will dry up again when the rains stop and is therefore more of a feature than a waterway. Which is what is described by <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/831/ponzu"></a><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/831/ponzu">@ponzu</a></a>. I would still go with waterway=wadi which I would recommend being a pecked brown line rather than blue, but we are restricted to what is available at the present. If there is sufficient use of the tag waterway=wadi then there will be sufficient case for renaming and/or rendering it differently. The present opposition to the brown pecked line is the clash with highway=track. The discussion regarding rendering is here <a href="https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/805">https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/805</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/1255#issuecomment-71403860">https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/1255#issuecomment-71403860</a></p>

<p>I think one issue with "wadi" is that is also means the entire valley that said dry waterway may be in.</p>

<p>This type of issue crops up in a number of discussions. There is no way that we are going to find a single word in our language that will satisfy all languages throughout the world. Even in the Arabic languages the meaning of wadi can range from a flowing river to a dry valley depending on where you are. In the Maghreb wadi applies to all rivers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadi">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadi</a></p>

<p>I tend to agree and feel we need a more generic tag such as something like waterway=dry_watercourse The wadi would be one of the many variations that could fit under such a category.</p>
