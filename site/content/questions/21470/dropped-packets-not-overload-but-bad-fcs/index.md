Dropped packets are packets that didn't make it into the capture file for performance reasons but had been seen by dumpcap. Packets with bad FCS will be dropped at the switch or at least on the receiving NIC, so dumpcap and Wireshark will never even know it has been there.</p><p>You can read more about it here: <a href="http://blog.packet-foo.com/2013/05/capturing-damaged-frames/">http://blog.packet-foo.com/2013/05/capturing-damaged-frames/</a></p><p>I guess you need to get capture equipment that can capture damaged frames.

I double check all connections. The fact is, Wireshark <em>sees</em> damaged packets. When i issue 100 packets, the sum of q'ty of received and dropped packets, is always 100... I know that is uncommon, and damaged packet should be dropped in many places before it arrives to Wireshark, but the fact is it don't. So the more precise question may be, which event in system lead to displaying dropped packets in Wireshark, except they are explicitly dropped by Wireshark (due to system overload or other rule). Because this can give a (tiny) chance to see damaged packets. But if 'dropped' means just calculation of kernel/driver events like <em>'dropped by NIC due to RX buffer overflow <strong>or</strong> any other receive error'</em>, there is no chance to dump, i think. But still may be a chance to display such events with timestamp in capture list.

That's just 'good' packets that did not make it into the capture file for some reason (most likely hard disk speed). Maybe it's not a constant stream on packets (as you said) but instead there is a burst of packets for short time intervals. Try to write the capture file to RAM disk and (most certainly) you will no longer see any dropped packets in Wireshark.</p><blockquote><p>I am sorry but can't understand how manageable switch can do it better...until it can dump or fix damaged packets.</p></blockquote><p>it cannot dump or fix damaged packets, but it can <strong>show</strong> that there are some damaged packets.
