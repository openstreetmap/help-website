The plink binary then runs tcpdump with -i and -w and then we pipe that to wireshark with -k -i and - to capture the traffic with a distinct BAT file per interface (each mirror interface receiver on the Ubuntu VM handles different flows we want to watch). It's worked great for years with Wireshark (1.8, 1.10, 1.12 and 2.0) but if we upgrade our Wireshark instance to 2.2.x we get an error dialog from the Wireshark GUI that says, "Unrecognized libpcap format or not libpcap data" and the BAT window says, "Unable to write to standard output: The pipe is being closed".</p><p>We haven't changed the Ubuntu system where the TCPDUMP command is running, the plink binary, or the Windows host OS.<br />
If we uninstall Wireshark 2.2.x and go back to the latest Wireshark 2.0 it starts working again If we re-upgrade from 2.0.x to 2.2.x again it fails again.</p><p>Any thoughts?</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags"><span class="post-tag tag-link-pipe" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;pipe&#39;">pipe</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-remote-capture" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;remote-capture&#39;">remote-capture</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-tcpdump" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;tcpdump&#39;">tcpdump</span></div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>11 May '17, 08:34</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/efd6c87b3ea03d76a316e1bc5cf19a07?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="dbAtAffirmed&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>dbAtAffirmed</span><br />

The 2.2.7 for WinX64 doesn't appear to include an extcap binary however (is it limited to Linux at this time?). I have an extcap folder with a USBPcapCMD.exe but in the main directory only an extcap.html. I'll file the defect in Bugzilla and then downgrade to 2.0.13 to keep our day-to-day workflow operational.</p></div><div id="comment-62173-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(20 Jun '17, 07:37)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">dbAtAffirmed</span></div></div><span id="62176"></span><div id="comment-62176" class="comment"><div id="post-62176-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>There's no binary called <code>extcap</code>, extcap is the name of an API. And USBPcapCMD.exe is just one of the binaries interfaced using that API. If an executable file is found in the appropriate folder, Wireshark executes it with a set of parameters and gets the list of interfaces as a response, then takes them one by one and determines their parameters etc., and then adds them to the list of interfaces available for capturing. When you start capture at one of them, it calls the binary with yet another set of parameters and expects the binary to send it the capture through a named pipe.</p></div><div id="comment-62176-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(20 Jun '17, 08:37)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div><span id="62184"></span><div id="comment-62184" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-62184-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks Sindy. I've tested it on Linux and it appears to work with some limitations relative to my old method however, more importantly (in our use case) there does not appear to be a SSH plugin that I can find via Google searches for the WinX64 version of Wireshark. I was hoping if one was not included that I could add one to the extcap directory and link things up.</p><p>I'm waiting on my Bugzilla account but will file a defect.
