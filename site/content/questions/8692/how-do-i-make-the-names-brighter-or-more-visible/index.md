<p>Hi, I'm generating highway/street names for a map and although I have set the color to white (#FFFFFF) and the font size to a large enough size, the names are not as clear as I had hoped they would be. Another way to describe it is that it looks pixelated. And the map background is not bright enough that it's affecting the visibility of these labels. I added a white label model (.osg file) onto the map and it looks much brighter than the generated white labels. Is there a way to modify this?</p>
<p>Thanks, Ken</p>

<p>Please explain the technology used. How do you produce the map, and how do you add the labels? Where exactly have you specified the #FFFFFF and can you perhaps supply a visual example?</p>
