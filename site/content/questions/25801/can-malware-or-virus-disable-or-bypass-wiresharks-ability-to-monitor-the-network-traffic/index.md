Why should a malware developer take the effort to hide from Wireshark? To prevent network analysis of his malware? Well, that's kind of a silly argument, because I just need to run Wireshark off-box (as @Jasper already mentioned) or run the malware in a virtual machine an then capture the traffic of the virtual machine. To sum it up: It makes no sense at all for a malware author to invest time into "Wireshark stealth code", as it is too easy to circumvent that 'stealth' mode.</p><p>I suggest you ask the person how told you that for a proof of his statement, like the name of the malware, etc. Only then we can take a look at that malware and speculate why the malware author might have implemented it.</p><p>Regards<br />

McAfee doesn't mention any intention of these evade detection beyond a normal virus or malware. The last two are known to use port 80 as a destination. The last one, also, has an IP address associated with its activity. They don't appear to go to any extraordinary efforts to mask any activity. I don't believe they can evade WireShark from the documenation that i have found.</p></div><div id="comment-25813-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(09 Oct '13, 07:01)</span> TimRC</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-25805" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-25805-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
