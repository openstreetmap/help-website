<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently started working on moving all our maps implementations from google maps to OSM and wanted to host everything on our servers as it's more for commercial use.</p>
<p>We require the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Map to mark a few coordinates (Leaflet with our own server would work I guess)</li>
<li>A map with search box where a user can search for a location (with auto complete feature) and accordingly get the corresponding map of that location. Then he can pin point a particular lat, long for which we'll do reverse geocoding.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the 2nd point what I could think of was that we would require OSMnames, leaflet, nominatim but i'm unable to figure out how to combine leaflet with OSMnames which uses are own tile server</p>
<p>Can someone suggest what can be done? Also, am I doing it the right way?</p>
