<p>There is a community guideline describing what are considered "trivial transformations" of OSM data, but it doesn't quite answer how should the license be interpreted in the following case. Let's say that I import all the shops (nodes tagged "shop") for a certain area from OSM. Based on their "name"-tags, I then search for the same shops using for example Yelp API, from which I probably receive opening hours, website, and other contact information.</p>
<p>Based on this sentence on OSM Legal FAQ, it would seem that showing these to datasets together is not considered to be a "derivative database", which should be distributed with OSM license: "However, if the two datasets are matched "trivially" by, for example, automated matching using a simple criterion such as name/locality, this is not "substantial" and remains a Collective Database."</p>
<p>Is my interpretation correct? If this is considered to be a "derivative database", this would obviously make it impossible to use OSM data with any other non-openly licensed online dataset, such as Yelp or even Facebook pages belonging to the same shops.</p>
<p>What then if I give my users opportunity to edit the data - of which some part has been received from OSM (probably just name &amp; coordinates) and some part from other sources? Will this database be still considered to be "collective database"?</p>

<p>The help site is the wrong place to ask for legal advice, the right place is the office of your legal counsel.</p>
<p>If there are use cases of general interest that need clarification they can be submitted to the legal working group ( legal@osmfoundation.org ) which may or may not support adding a community norm on the subject. The LWG cannot vet individual business plans, not only from a time, legal and liability point of view, it would also require full disclosure of your business plan to start with.</p>

<p>Thank you for being unhelpful. The Legal FAQ links here for questions: <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Legal_FAQ#5a._I_have_questions._Can_you_answer_them.3F">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Legal_FAQ#5a._I_have_questions._Can_you_answer_them.3F</a> .</p>
<p>This is not a question about any individual business plan, but a legal question which also many others who care about licenses certainly have. There are plenty of open, but not openly licensed data sources online, I mentioned Yelp just as an example.</p>
