Your capturing mechanism failed to capture them. Wireshark is telling you (correctly) about this.</p><p>There are ACKs to data packets that aren't seen in the trace. This means that the real receiver must really have received those data packets. They are missing from the trace but not missing from the real flow.</p><p>It could have been that your switch didn't mirror them (didn't forward them to your sniffer PC) or that your capturing PC couldn't keep up with the arrival rate of the mirrored packets.</p><p>See Jasper's very good article on the topic of ordinary NIC cards not keeping up. <a href="https://blog.packet-foo.com/2016/11/the-network-capture-playbook-part-3-network-cards/">https://blog.packet-foo.com/2016/11/the-network-capture-playbook-part-3-network-cards/</a></p><p>Your Dup-ACK (packet #48) is interesting because it is actually a Selective ACK. Given that a normal ACK (#49) arrives just 12 microseconds later to acknowledge the data reported "missing" by the SACK, my guess is that at least one packet arrived at the receiver out-of-order but the overtaken packet arrived just 12 microseconds late.</p><p>Here's a TCP-Trace chart which shows the data packets advancing upwards - with clearly observable gaps. However, the ACK line also advances all the way upwards, fully acknowledging every data packet - even the missing ones.</p><p><img src="https://osqa-ask.wireshark.org/upfiles/6500-anon-TCP-Stream.png" alt="alt text" /></p><p><img src="https://osqa-ask.wireshark.org/upfiles/6500-anon-TCP-Stream-Notes.png" alt="alt text" /></p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>26 Feb '17, 03:06</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/35a0c1d0cf15b9d54d73bf54ae28abcd?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Philst&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>Philst</span><br />
