<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I am sincerely sorry that I made a mistake in deleting 313549237 (It's a power line but the map thought it was something wrong and asked me whether I wanted to delete it, and I stupidly did (It is created by someone else).) I am worried that my action will affect the user who created this power line and is relying on it in their application. Next time, the user should obviously label it as power line to avoid confusions. I use the tool 'ID' and not potlatch 1, which I have heard you can revert with. How can I revert 313549237? I do not mind someone helping me do it if it is easier than explaining it to me. Sorry for my stupidity/beginner mistakes. I looked at the different forums and also <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Potlatch_1/Primer#Undoing_mistakes">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Potlatch_1/Primer#Undoing_mistakes</a> but I can't figure out a way to do it. Many thanks</p>
<p>Many thanks, XWB</p>

<p>I've undeleted it (using Potatch 1), but I'm not sure it was a power line - <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/313549237/history">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/313549237/history</a> has no tags on it, and it connects two highway=service roads. I'd suggest just adding the power line in separately, and then deleting that untagged way again.</p>

<p>If you know the id, I would suggest undeleting with JOSM (the next time). P1, while historically very important, is definitely going to go the way of the Dodo as soon as the last browsers drop flash (and I suspect that the API maintainers will sigh with relief when they can get rid of the code that is specific to this feature).</p>
<p>Currently there are a couple of specialised tools and JOSM that support "undeleting" and reverting changes, I haven't seen support for such a feature in any iD road map, but never say never.</p>
