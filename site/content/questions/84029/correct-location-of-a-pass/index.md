<p>As part of a personal project that will use OSM data on road passes, I am interested in how they are listed on the map. According to the wiki, "<em>a mountain_pass=yes tag should be the highest point of the way, so it's a single node on that way.</em>"</p>
<p>In general it's pretty straightforward, but I wonder what it is for road passes with tunnels, like the Rousset pass in France (56415172).</p>
<p>The highest point of the road is in the tunnel (which is flat), according to the wiki, a mountain_pass=yes should be added.</p>
<p>However, the "real" pass is on a footpath above the tunnel (905187823), and the mountain_pass tag is assigned to it.</p>
<p>I looked at other similar situations, like the Lukmanier pass (1478875365), and another decision seems to have been made. What do you think is the most appropriate placement of the mountain_pass tag in these tunnel situations?</p>

<p>I personally would not tag a location within a tunnel as a mountain pass. To me that is a surface feature.</p>
<p>So I agree with the tagging on the first situation you list where the pass is tagged on a trail and not on the highway tunnel.</p>
<p>It does, however, leave open the situation where the two halves of a divided highway are at different elevations when going over a pass. Or where a foot trail crosses at a different elevation than an adjacent highway. Fortunately, that is not the question you asked.</p>
