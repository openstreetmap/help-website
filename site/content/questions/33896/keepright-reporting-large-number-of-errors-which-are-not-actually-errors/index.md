<p>Not sure if this is the right place to ask about keepright.</p>
<p>I just realized that keepright is reporting lot of errors which are actually not errors. Both keepright site and Keepright in QAT script (<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Quality_Assurance_Tools_script)">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Quality_Assurance_Tools_script)</a> reports these errors.</p>
<p>There are lot of "This highway intersects the highway #nnnnnnn but there is no junction node" errors around my neighbourhood. When I open them in JOSM, I can see that there are junction nodes (<a href="http://keepright.ipax.at/report_map.php?schema=48&amp;error=61177150)">http://keepright.ipax.at/report_map.php?schema=48&amp;error=61177150)</a></p>
<p>Tagging these as false positive is not a practical as there are large number of such errors being reported. How can I report this issue to the developers?</p>
