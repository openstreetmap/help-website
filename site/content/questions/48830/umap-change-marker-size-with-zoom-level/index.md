<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm wondering if anyone knows a way to change the marker size when zooming in and out? I am creating a map with almost 300 markers but when zooming out the markers are too large and overlap each other. If there was a way to make them smaller when zooming out it would look so much better.</p>
<p>There is an option for markers called "Zoom level for automatic zooms" but when I change the values nothing seems to happen. I'm not sure this option is even for what I think it is.</p>
<p>If anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks, Ross</p>
