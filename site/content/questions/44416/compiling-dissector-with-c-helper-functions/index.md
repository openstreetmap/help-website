The issue is that I intend to create an installer so I can distribute my build, but I think that creating an installer with the generated .so or .o file would create dependencies on the C compiler.

Of course a lot of wireshark's internals are still compiled as C and linked with <code>extern "C"</code> wrappers and so forth; which is presumably why <code>wireshark-glue-GoogleProtoBuf.cc</code> uses the <code>extern "C"</code> wrapper as well.</p><p>But if you can compile it as a separate plugin today, I don't see why you can't as part of the installer's package, but still remain as a plugin - Wireshark already ships with some other plugins today.</p></div><div id="comment-44423-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(23 Jul '15, 17:22)</span> Hadriel</div></div><span id="44428"></span><div id="comment-44428" class="comment"><div id="post-44428-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>OK, so I added the files the way you normally add dissectors, and it's giving me this error.

All of the built-in dissectors are pure C-code, and compiled as such.</p><p>What you want to do is compile the protobuf thing as a <em>plugin</em>, not a regular built-in dissector. There's a <code>README.plugins</code> file in the wireshark source in the <code>doc</code> directory you may want to read. And obviously there's the <code>README.txt</code> in the protobuf plugin site's source you pointed to. It looks like the protobuf plugin generator python script creates the necessary makefiles for the plugin, so my guess is it's just a matter of running that script, then invoking those generated makefiles from the installer stuff in wireshark.</p><p>But again, that's not my area of knowledge for wireshark - I focus more on wireshark's Lua API code. (and as it happens I've been thinking of writing a Lua script for wireshark to decode google's protobuf messages using the <code>.proto</code> files)</p></div><div id="comment-44429-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(24 Jul '15, 06:52)</span> Hadriel</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-44416" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-44416-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
