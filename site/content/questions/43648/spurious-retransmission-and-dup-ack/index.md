For that kind you got a spurious retransmission, a retransmitted ACK and in the end the servr closes the connection with a FIN. So somewhere in your network between capture point and server your packet got lost or blocked.</p></div><div id="comment-43649-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(29 Jun '15, 00:14)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Christian_R</span></div></div><span id="43650"></span><div id="comment-43650" class="comment"><div id="post-43650-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Hi Christian_R,</p><p>Thanks for your answer, appreciate it.

Also you can see in the primary picture that the whole session inclusive Request has a duration of 13ms. Which seems to be fine.</p><p>But in the second picture the session has a duration of more than 10 Minutes. So what we see is that the session has been initiated at 05:46:48.155. But after the 3WAY Handshake, when normally the POST Request is transmitted nothing happens. So the server starts the discussed "Spurious Retransmission" after ~30 sec. Then ~30 sec after the 3WAY Handshake (05:47:39.491) the server terminates the session by a half close (FIN-Bit). Which is more or less immediately ACKED by the client, so the client is still alive.</p><p>But the client does not close his half-session, too. Because he still wants to send something. And then after more than 9 Minutes (that is what I meant with delayed) he sends his Request. After that he is glad and closes the session in the same milisecond as the Request, too. The responds this with an RST. In this case the RST has sent, beause the server has closed his socket in the meantime of 9 Minutes.</p><p>So the question is what causes the client to pause for that long time.</p><p>Is this the description you were missing or do you need more info?</p></div><div id="comment-43774-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(01 Jul '15, 03:12)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Christian_R</span></div></div><span id="43807"></span><div id="comment-43807" class="comment"><div id="post-43807-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks for the clear explanation, I guess it's time for the client to check on their server not.

That will allow you to manually add and save names with the capture file. You can simply right click on a packet and choose Manually Resolve Name where you can assign a name to an IP. Then you won't need to block them out (At least not in the summary pane).</p><p>2) Add 2 custom columns to the summary pane:</p><p>ip.id<br />
ip.ttl</p><p>3) Always display the column headers as it will be easier to tell which IP is the src or dst.</p><p>As to your issue it does appear the server is either not receiving the ACK or ignoring it.

The client's TCP stack immediately DUP-ACKs it but as Christian mentioned the client application process just seems to have gone to sleep. So the server waits a little longer and then FINs the connection.</p></div><div id="comment-43760-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(30 Jun '15, 19:25)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">KevinB</span></div></div><span id="43761"></span><div id="comment-43761" class="comment"><div id="post-43761-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks for your comment, I guess I'll need to talk to the client to check on their side again haha.
