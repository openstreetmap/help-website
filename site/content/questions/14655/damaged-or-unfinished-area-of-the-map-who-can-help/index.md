<p>Hi, I noticed today that <strong>a part of a map</strong> previously OK <strong>is now missing</strong>. This is the area: <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?box=yes&amp;maxlat=53.7308&amp;maxlon=16.7933&amp;minlat=53.6499&amp;minlon=16.6055">please see</a> I started fixing it ... but found out it was a tremendous work and did not finalize.</p>
<p>Since I am relatively new here please bear with my questions and try to help: 1) is there a moderator for a particular area of the map to make sure that it is not degraded? 2) could the moderator or could anyone go back and revert the changes that damaged the area that I am speaking about? 3) could sb. tell me if there is work on this area which is the cause of the damage? Thanks!</p>
<p>P.S. I you can revert the area to it's original form it would be perfect ...</p>

<p>1) No. Many mappers watch their own local area for changes though.</p>
<p>2) I suspect the changes are due to the impending licence change (see "read more" link above as at time of writing), so no - contributions by people who haven't agreed to the new licence have had to be removed.</p>
<p>3) I think I might have answered that in 2 above.</p>
<p>Basically, yes, fixing it as you have been doing is the way forward, and in some areas the work involved is more than in others. Poland and Australia were the most affected countries I believe, and <a href="http://rebuild.poole.ch/">http://rebuild.poole.ch/</a> already has various tasks covering parts of those countries so any mapper can try and help repair the damage.</p>
