<p>Where I live we have many polygons that are identical in geometry. They may have different tags. Some of these are in relations and I can find the "inner" ones using OSMOSE with the multipolygon box checked.</p>
<p>However, I would like to find them all with an overpass query.</p>
<p>I'm comfortable using the overpass Wizard but need help with a specialized query like this. Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Here's an example of two closed ways that are identical in shape and location. These happen two have "inner" roles in a multipoloygon and were found by OSMOSE.</p>
