<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a mentor for a local school who are involved with the charity, AppsForGood. As part of their work, students have to come up with app ideas that can be developed with a partnering app development firm.</p>
<p>As a mentor, my role is to support the students with their ideas and help them execute the apps efficiently. One group is looking to create a bridleway app. They have found the website <a href="http://www.bridlewaymap.com/">http://www.bridlewaymap.com/</a> that outlines all bridleways in the UK, utilising the Open Street Maps service. What I want to know is, is it possible for a development firm to use this existing data to create the app? I don't need the ins and outs of how to do it, but I need to know whether the students could use existing data or have to input all bridleways themselves - which is obviously a key factor when deciding whether they should run with this idea or not.</p>
<p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

<p>Yes, you can use the underlying OSM data. I don't know whether they have used other data sources for their map. If they did, you have to ask the copyright owners of that data for permission.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Develop">wiki for developers</a> for more information on using the OSM data in your application.</p>

<p>Whether they can use "this existing data" (i.e. the data as presented by <a href="http://www.bridlewaymap.com/">http://www.bridlewaymap.com/</a> , including the style of the underlying map tiles) I'm not sure - the tiles are hosted at Mapbox (a company separate from OpenStreetMap, that offers services using OpenStreetMap data and knowledge) and the tile style may be one of theirs. However as <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/5390/escada">@escada</a> says, the underlying OpenStreetMap data can certainly be used (see <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">this page</a> for details).</p>
<p>Your students would have to decide "what constitutes a bridleway" of course - it might be "something the physically looks like a bridleway" or "something that has the legal status of Public Bridleway", or perhaps some combination (which is what <a href="http://www.bridlewaymap.com/">http://www.bridlewaymap.com/</a> looks like it is showing).</p>
