<p>Hello, there.</p>
<p>I would like to map some waterways and related features in karst regions, but I have some questions to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>isn't there a way to distinguish the different types of sinkholes? As far as I know, there is only <code>natural=sinkhole</code>, but that can designate the same a karst spring, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estavelle">estavelle</a>, a doline, (which is a sinkhole filled with clay of such materials, so there is no real hole), and a losing stream. How to distinguish them when mapping?</li>
<li>I know some partly or totally losing streams; I suppose I have to set the stream bed between them as intermittent, but, when a stream loses to reappear in a different stream bed, shouldn't I map this link? If so, how?</li>
<li>I also know a place where a closed iron mine collapsed, creating a funnel-like formation, similar to a sinkhole, but man made; should I still map it as <code>natural=sinkhole</code>?</li>
<li>when mapping an estavelle, how should I map the intermittent connected stream, as it can be an input as an output of the estavelle? Should I map the stream in one way, then remap it the other way, both as intermittent?</li>
</ul>
<p>Hoping you can enlighten me,</p>
<p>Regards.</p>
