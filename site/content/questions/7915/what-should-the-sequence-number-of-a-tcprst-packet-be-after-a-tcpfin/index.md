And now it gets interesting:</li><li>The Client sends just a RST without an ACK number being set (just 0 Bytes). That way the servers retransmission trigger kicks in because of unacknowldged data (RTO ~ 200ms and then doubleing up -&gt; 400, 800, 1600 ... see frames 654 to end)</li><li>The servers stack "should" react to the clients RST in frame 653, BUT due to the sequence number being 894 and the server having ACKed 895 this RST is ouf of the servers recieve window (you also see that it doesn't trigger a DUP Ack...) so my strong suggestion is that the server ignores the RST</li></ol><p>Actually I would expect the servers stack behaviour to be normal for preventing RST spoofing attacks in some way.

Let me expand. This sequence of packets was captured at the server side. The RST in frame 4 is a response on the data in frame 2 (which acknowledges the data up to the FIN, but not including the phantom byte of the FIN).</p><p>The client has no knowledge yet of frame 3, so it only sees that the server expects data at sequence number X (the X of frame 2), that would vote for seq=X for the RST.</p><p>However, the client has indeed sent a FIN, which means the phantom byte should be taken into account, so seq=X+1 would be logical too.</p></div><div id="comment-7920-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(12 Dec '11, 12:31)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">SYN-bit ♦♦</span></div></div><span id="7925"></span><div id="comment-7925" class="comment"><div id="post-7925-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>OK, now it gets interesting: If the client did not get frame 3 already he could in theory use X or X+1 as seq.nr. depending on the stacks way of implementing RST connection teardowns.

I do agree that the RST is out-of-window and therefor is not accepted by the server. However, looking at it some more, I think the seq with which the client was sending it was also right. It responded to the frame with an ack with the same value.</p><p>The reason the server retransmitted over and over again is that there is a loadbalancer in between which stopped forwarding the frames properly after seeing the first RST. If it would have forwarded the packets, there would have been a frame with the higher ack which would trigger a RST with an in-window seq.</p><p>Thanks for both your insights :-)</p></div><div id="comment-8026-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(17 Dec '11, 02:56)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">SYN-bit ♦♦</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-7917" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 6 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 1 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-7917-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
