<p>I need a route updating that goes over a bridge where it is currently showing this bridge as closed even though the Bridge is open as normal.</p>
<p>The Bridge is named "Worcester Bridge" with the affected route being from "Bridge Street, Bull Ring, St Clements, Worcester, Worcestershire, West Midlands, England, WR1 3NY, United Kingdom" to New Road, Bull Ring, St Clements, Worcester, Worcestershire, West Midlands, England, WR2 4RL, United Kingdom" - any routes that require to from the Bridge street side to the New Road side take the incorrect route and go all the way around as opposed going across the bridge.</p>
<p>Can someone update this please?</p>

<p>A barrier (kerb) had inadvertently been added at the intersecting node of Bridge Street and the South Quay cycleway. It looks like it was intended to be mapped on the cycleway, but got tagged on the intersection instead. Since it was on the intersection of those ways, the barrier also applied to Bridge Street and was blocking vehicle routing (tested with OSRM). I've moved the barrier to the South Quay way, so it won't affect Bridge Street anymore. It could take a few days for the OSRM routing to update, and varying lengths of time for other routers to update.</p>
