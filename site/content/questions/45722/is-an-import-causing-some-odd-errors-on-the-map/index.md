It still appeared at some zoom levels but i could not see it in edit mode so i assume someone had seen the error and deleted it. I wanted to know who had mapped it so i did a search for Cochina Road and found the same name in the USA some odd mapping. here is an examples. <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=cochina%20road#map=3/40.49/-54.48">http://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=cochina%20road#map=3/40.49/-54.48</a> and <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/360780242#map=2/47.3/-56.3">http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/360780242#map=2/47.3/-56.3</a> is is some sort of import gone wrong?

<p>It seems to me tne original Cochina Road was mapped several years ago correctly, then an import added to this way with several atlantic crossing which are shown on my jpeg in the UK. If you zoom into my second link you will see the alantic "way" is in fact over six parallel ways.</p>

<p>The extensions end in Norwich so I have commented on the changeset also sent a polite email. If there is no response the Norwich nodes can easily be deleted thus removing the extended way. I'll leave it a few days.</p>

<p>Thanks BC for looking at it I took SomeoneElse's advice and I messaged the mapper last night and he replied quickley "Thanks for the feedback, I'm going to look into what happened. I'm importing using the ArcGIS for OpenStreetMap tools."... so hopfully he will be able to sort it. Like you also found one of the end nodes in Norwich. I was tempted to delete it but though breaking the edit might make fixing it even more of a problem so left it. I am confident the mapper is on the case.</p>

<p>Closing given that the root cause has been resolved and the issue of the rogue import is being discussed in the appropriate places. Naturally it is yet another example of a destructive and badly executed import.</p>
