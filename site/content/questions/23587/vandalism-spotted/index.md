<p>@ Frederik Ramm: I mostly disagree with your closing comment below.</p>
<p>Mailinglists and their archives are as for eternity as this help system is. (imho MLs are even more longtime but nvm)<br />
</p>
<p>Although Amaroussi seems more experienced handling OSM assumingly there are a lot of people who don't know what IRC is. Even better: This help forum is directly linked on osm.org, IRC nor MLs aren't.</p>
<p>Since IRC is more volatile as this forum it is more likely to get an answer here than in IRC. (absent users)</p>
<p>Why would any discussion about how to handle vandalism in this help forum not helpful to others?</p>

### The question has been closed for the following reason "Please don't use this help system for specific issues like "what about the vandalism by user X done on the DATE" or "what is wrong with way Y". Mailing lists or IRC are better suited for that kind of volatile discussion; it makes no sense to archive such things on this help system for eternity, and any discussion that would result from your question will not be helpful to others who spot vandalism." by Frederik Ramm 21 Jun '13, 19:51
