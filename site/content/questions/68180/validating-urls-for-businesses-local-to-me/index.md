<p>Hi</p>
<p>Keepright returns far to many false errors (404s etc) with regard to URLs in my locale. I was informed it was because the server was based in another country &amp; not all sites get 'registered'.</p>
<p>Is there a technique (pinging?) to check them using a local server? Ideally I'd like to do it automatically using some form of scripting language . I'm not expecting someone to write it for me, but any pointers in the right direction would be useful.</p>
