There are 2 teamed NIC cards which I'm capturing from and a replication NIC card with a different subnet address that has no issues. This server is part of an e-mail cluster. The capture usually runs fine. We have a very intermittent issue where the whole of e-mail hangs. I managed to capture the 6 servers traffic during the slow running/hanging and all servers seemed to be running fine except for one. The traffic dropped by about 99% and was the one way traffic as described above. NB - the ACK number in the TCP Acked unseen segment does grow Many thanks</p></div><div id="comment-51629-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(13 Apr '16, 04:55)</span> bbfluff</div></div><span id="51630"></span><div id="comment-51630" class="comment"><div id="post-51630-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>The way you put it (the capture usually runs fine, but now you've exceptionally had a one-way traffic case) I could imagine there is a relationship between the original issue you're tracking and the capturing issue. As you talk of teaming, I assume there is a manufacturer's (let me guess: Broadcom's) proprietary teaming driver, and the interaction between it and the WinPcap's <code>nfs</code> may be complex too.</p><p>I was recently dealing with Npcap vs. WinPcap difference, where WinPcap can access members NICs of a software bridge whereas Npcap can only access the virtual NIC "connected" to the bridge.</p><p>Do you use WinPcap or Npcap?</p><p>Do you capture at the virtual NIC representing the team or at one of team members?</p><p>If Wireshark/tshark/dumpcap offers you the two team <strong>members</strong> as NICs available for capture, could you capture at both simultaneously?</p><p>If it offers only the virtual NIC representing the team, can you disable/disconnect one of the team members and capture again?</p></div><div id="comment-51630-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(13 Apr '16, 05:27)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="51631"></span><div id="comment-51631" class="comment"><div id="post-51631-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>The teaming driver is microsoft network adapter multiplexor.
