Suppose there were 5 packets. The receiver would do nothing when packet 1 arrives, ACK packet 2, do nothing when packet 3 arrives, ACK packet 4, do nothing when packet 5 arrives, and then be stuck waiting for packet 6 to arrive.</p><p>What happens with the delayed ACK timer?</p><p>Packet 1 arrives: Start the 200 ms delayed ACK timer.

MS does not require full MSS packets. So two tiny packets arriving back to back is enough to trigger an immediate ACK (no delayed ack required). Some Unix systems required two full MSS packets before ack'ing. So if only one packet arrives, or two small (less than full MSS) packets arrive, delayed ack timers will be honored. The values range from 50ms, 75ms, 100ms, 150ms or 200ms.<br />
