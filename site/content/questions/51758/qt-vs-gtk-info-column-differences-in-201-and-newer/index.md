Columns should not be filled under a tree presence condition, as indicated in the documentation doc/README.dissector:</p><p>"Note, however, that you must fill in column information, create conversations, reassemble packets, do calls to "expert" functions, build any other persistent state needed for dissection, and call subdissectors regardless of whether "tree" is NULL or not."</p><p>The fact that it works with GTK UI is by chance and not by design.</p><p>So, for example, code that reads like</p><pre><code>if (tree) {

    ...

    proto_tree_add_XXX(...);

    ...

    col_add_fstr(pinfo-&gt;cinfo, COL_PROTOCOL, &quot;Xyzzy (%u)&quot;, code);

    ...

    proto_tree_add_xxx(...);
}</code></pre><p>is incorrect, and should, instead, be:</p><pre><code>if (tree) {

    ...

    proto_tree_add_XXX(...);

    ...
}

col_add_fstr(pinfo-&gt;cinfo, COL_PROTOCOL, &quot;Xyzzy (%u)&quot;, code);

if (tree) {
    ...

    proto_tree_add_xxx(...);
}</code></pre><p>so that, while code that adds to the protocol tree is inside <code>if (tree) {</code> and <code>}</code>, and is executed only if <code>tree</code> is not null, code that sets or updates the column information is <em>not</em> inside <code>if (tree) {</code> and <code>}</code> and is executed regardless of whether <code>tree</code> is null or not.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>18 Apr '16, 10:14</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/713f24fd877861260b71ecd455018625?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Pascal%20Quantin&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>Pascal Quantin</span><br />

Paragraph 1.4.4(4) of README.dissector further states:</p><p>"If the Protocol column will ultimately be set to, for example, a value containing a protocol version number, with the version number being a field in the packet, the dissector should, before fetching the version number field or any other field from the packet, set it to a value without a version number, using 'col_set_str', and should later set it to a value with the version number after it's fetched the version number."</p><p>This implies that info columns can and should be updated, if needed. This is observed in the Gtk user interface, but not on the Qt interface of Wireshark 2.0.2. Therefore, your statement that "columns should not be filled under a tree presence condition" is not indicated in your reference, and explaining the behavior as occurring "by chance" if a bit hard to swallow (let alone calling it a bug in my part).</p></div><div id="comment-51769-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(18 Apr '16, 16:27)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">coloncm</span></div></div><span id="51770"></span><div id="comment-51770" class="comment"><div id="post-51770-score" class="comment-score">1</div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>First of all, I said that my dissector, which has been maintained since version 1.10.3, worked on versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1, so any fixes and performance enhancements made since 2.0.0 did not produce the observed behavior difference described here.</p></blockquote><p>A performance change made since 2.0.1 <em>could</em> produce the observed behavior difference described here.</p><blockquote><p>info columns are being populated "once" on a dissector pass (whether or not the tree is passed)</p></blockquote><p>So you have verified, by checking the value of <code>tree</code> passed to your dissector, that the Info column is populated with the correct value even if a non-null value is never passed to <code>tree</code>?</p><blockquote><p>This is the case in my dissector and has nothing to do with the presence of the tree, nor prohibits population of the info column in the presence of a tree.</p></blockquote><p>What's prohibited is population of the Info column <em>only</em> in cases where <code>tree</code> is set.</p><p>Paragraph 1.4.4(3) of README.dissector is not talking about the entire dissector, it's talking only about the code that's run before anything is fetched from the packet.</p><blockquote><p>Therefore, your statement that "columns should not be filled under a tree presence condition" is not indicated in your reference,</p></blockquote><p>His reference is section 2.11 paragraph 4, which, as indicated, says</p><blockquote><p>Note, however, that you must fill in column information, ... regardless of whether "tree" is NULL or not.</p></blockquote><p>which quite clearly indicates that columns should not be filled in inside code that is run only if <code>tree</code> is null (or only if <code>tree</code> is non-null).</p></div><div id="comment-51770-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(18 Apr '16, 16:51)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Guy Harris ♦♦</span></div></div><span id="51771"></span><div id="comment-51771" class="comment"><div id="post-51771-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I think we're splitting hairs, here. I took a second look at 2.0.1 and noticed that the same behavior was occurring, but not in 2.0.0, where I discovered the difference, so I will edit my question to specifically mention that. Reading between the lines, it appears that, since 2.0.1, performance enhancements were made that prohibits the update of info columns. If that's the case, I am fine with it. But, to call out observers of behavior differences to be causers of them is unfair.</p><p>Paragraph 1.4, where I am referencing from, is titled "Functions to handle columns in the traffic summary window", which is what my question is about.</p><p>Paragraph 2.11 refers to optimizations of the entire dissector, not specifically implementation of info columns. Paragraph 4 refers to the previous paragraph (3) which states that, "in the interest of speed, avoid building a protocol tree and adding stuff to it, or even looking at any packet data needed only if you're building the protocol tree, if possible."</p><p>Again, if the API changed for the sake performance enhancements on the Qt interface, I think it at least ought to be mentioned, without the implication that someone else is doing it wrong. I might add that this does not bode well with Wireshark's full migration to Qt.</p></div><div id="comment-51771-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(18 Apr '16, 20:43)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">coloncm</span></div></div><span id="51774"></span><div id="comment-51774" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-51774-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>I think we're splitting hairs, here.</p></blockquote><p>No, but if it appears that way, the documentation is apparently unclear.</p><p>Updating the column data is permitted, <em>as long as the code that updates it is run regardless of whether <code>tree</code> is null or not</em>.
