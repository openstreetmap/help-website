<p>Hi I've tried contacting OpenRailwayMap &amp; its blog writer by email a few times over the past months, but received no replies. The mailing list is virtually deserted. Is there anyway of getting a response?</p>
<p>My question to them, in case someone here can answer: As OSM isn't a historic map I like to remove redundant entities such as abandoned railways. I'm aware OpenRailwayMap use the data &amp; so I don't want to completely delete it. A few years back there was talk of them setting up a secondary database to store historic rail data. Did this ever happen?</p>

<p>You aren't clear about where you wish to delete abandoned railways: as rendered items on OpenRailwayMap or in OSM itself. Could you clarify this?</p>
<p>OpenRailwayMap is open source on <a href="https://github.com/openrailwaymap/OpenRailwayMap/">GitHub</a>, and is actively maintained, so if this a request for rendering changes then it would be appropriate to raise an issue there.</p>
<p>Removing this data from OSM would be another matter entirely, and not appropriate for this Q&amp;A forum.</p>

<p>Unsure why there's a response almost 3 years after the event, especially when it doesn't answer anything, just finger wags.</p>
<p>I'm fully aware of what ORM is. I couldn't have been clearer than "As OSM isn't a historic map I like to remove redundant entities such as abandoned railways". This forum is just as good as any for discussing the removal of OSM data.</p>
