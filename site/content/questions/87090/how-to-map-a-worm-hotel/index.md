<p>Worm hotels have popped up in Vienna. Now I'm wondering how to map them.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-worm-hotel">What is a worm hotel?</h2>
<p>You might know the household-sized worm bins that use worms to compost certain kinds of organic waste. A worm hotel is the same thing, but sized up to be used by multiple people in a neighborhood.</p>
<h2 id="worm-hotels-in-vienna">Worm hotels in Vienna</h2>
<p>Worm hotels in Vienna are being put up and serviced by <a href="https://wurmhotel.com/">Wurmhotel</a> once enough people in a certain area have voiced their interest. They are open only to members who have gotten instructions on what to feed the worms.</p>
<p>What the worms should be fed according to the Wurmhotel website: raw fruits and vegetables, leaves, ground eggshells, 20% newspaper paper or carton. No citrus.</p>
<h2 id="worm-hotels-on-osm">Worm hotels on OSM</h2>
<p>Some worm hotels have been mapped in Amsterdam as:</p>
<pre><code>tourism = artwork
artwork_type = installation
man_made = worm_hotel</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/man_made=worm_hotel#overview"><code>man_made = worm_hotel</code></a> on Taginfo</p>
<h2 id="my-thoughts">My thoughts</h2>
<p>Worm hotels in Vienna are not intended as artworks, and for that reason I reject the tags used in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>They are intended as recycling facilities open to a limited crowd.</p>
<p>Thus I'm pretty sure about the following tags:</p>
<pre><code>amenity=recycling
recycling_type=container
access=private</code></pre>
<p>I'd consider adding <code>man_made = worm_hotel</code> too, since it has already been used. Although I am wondering if there is a more appropriate key than <code>man_made</code>.</p>
<p>But what kind of recycling is this? The worms' diet doesn't completely follow the usual concepts of organic waste. It's certainly not <code>recycling:food_waste</code> as described in the wiki, since the worms should not be fed cooked food or meat. I'd tend to go with something vague like <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/search?q=recycling%3Aorganic#keys"><code>recycling:organic</code></a> (by far the most popular) or <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/search?q=recycling%3Acompost#keys"><code>recycling:compost</code></a> (very rare, feels slightly more descriptive to me).</p>
<p>Any feedback appreciated!</p>
