<p>I recently took part in a small editwar over an unnamed (no official or locally reckognized name) private airstrip: <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/573934869/history">http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/573934869/history</a></p>
<p>I removed an obviously invented english name (the airstrip is in Denmark and an official name would most likely have been different from this) and after researching a bit tagged the strip noname=yes because I felt that would be the most factually correct.</p>
<p>After this the noname tag was removed and a descriptive name put back.</p>
<p>The airstrip in question is most likely the one mentioned in <a href="https://www.fyens.dk/modules/mobile/article?articleid=1749135">https://www.fyens.dk/modules/mobile/article?articleid=1749135</a></p>
<p>Is it ok for mappers to invent names (in a foreign language even) for essentially nameless private airstrips (and other features too)?</p>

<p>When is a name a name?</p>
<p>The (OED) dictionary defines "name" as "word(s) by which a person, place, animal, thing etc is known and spoken to or of".</p>
<p>This means that something doesn't have to have an "offical" name in order for the <code>name</code> tag to be set in OSM, but it should be "known" by that name, by a reasonable proportion of relevant people (people whom you would assume to be the authority on naming the thing in question - usually, those who interact with the thing on a regular basis because they live there).</p>
<p>The <code>name</code> tag (or its <code>name:xx</code> siblings) should not be used for</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>description</em> of an object ("farm", "beach access road")</li>
<li>a "niche name" that only very few people use to refer to the object, and that is therefore difficult to verify</li>
<li>a <em>translation</em> or <em>transliteration</em> of the real name (Pont Neuf in Paris is not called "New Bridge" in English hence a <code>name:en</code> tag is not appropriate)</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer your question, it is certainly not ok for a mapper to invent a name for an airstrip; however most names were invented at some point in history, so if someone invents a name and it catches on and a sizeable group of people refer to the thing by that name, then it's ok to be mapped.</p>
<p>Or if someone invents the name and puts it up on a big sign.</p>
