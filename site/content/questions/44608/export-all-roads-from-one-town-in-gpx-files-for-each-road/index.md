<p>What is teh benefit when you have all roads of a place in single files with its streetname as filename?</p>
<p>Why do you not use shapefile format or geoJSON or something similar?</p>
<p>Please edit your question and add some information about your aim in general.</p>
<p>Because I am not aware of such a GPX exporter.</p>
<p>Only I know is overpass-turbo.eu where you can query for features and export as ONE single GPX file ... or other better formats.</p>
