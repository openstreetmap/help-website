Can be seconds, minutes, hours.</p><blockquote><p>can you think about another solution for this problem ( with keeping use wireshark ),</p></blockquote><p>Only by making substantial changes to the internals of Wireshark, like dropping any data gathered after a TCP connection has been closed, as the IDS has seen the interesting parts.</p><blockquote><p>any suggestion for the memory problem?</p></blockquote><p>Well, buy a system with 256 GByte RAM. But that will only delay the problem ;-)</p><blockquote><p>does creating capture files as in (capture-options-use multiple files )</p></blockquote><p>Probably. If it is sufficient for your IDS that one process captures data and writes it to disk while another process (much later) analyzes the data, that could possibly be a solution. However, due to the delay between data capturing and analysis, the IDS would be a rather bad IDS, as the attack had been already taken place while you detect it in the capture file.</p><p>Why do you want to write your own IDS (there are free alternatives like snort, which you could extend/modify to match your requirements) and why do you need Wireshark for that? If we learn more about your project, maybe we can suggest another solution.</p></div><div id="comment-16096-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(19 Nov '12, 23:56)</span> Kurt Knochner ♦</div></div><span id="16100"></span><div id="comment-16100" class="comment"><div id="post-16100-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>my supervisor who specified using wireshark,It is an idea and I should find if it is workingor not.I extract some fields from the packet header to take a look at the network traffic if there is any possiblity for the existance of some threats.I found Lua API easy and there is not too many work on it as I read in one of your site Q.(Lua binding\integration-documentation), so I'd like to benefit from it.I need the wireshark files to be kept for the network administrator;in case of an alert is issued,and to extend work in future;keeping raw packets.

If that is good enough for your IDS, you could capture files with <code>dumpcap</code> (option: -i) for a period of one minute and write those files to disk (repeat that step indefinitely). Then a second process takes those files (hopefully small enough to process them in time) and analyzes them with tshark and your Lua code. After the analysis those files will be deleted.</p><p>For a low traffic environment this might work (somehow). In a high traffic environment you might get into trouble, if there is more data coming in, than you can process at the same time.</p></div><div id="comment-16102-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(20 Nov '12, 01:48)</span> Kurt Knochner ♦</div></div><span id="16104"></span><div id="comment-16104" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-16104-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>how can I do this((hopefully small enough to process them in time) and analyzes them )??
