<p>I guess you are <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Carson_gor">Carson_gor</a> in OSM and are asking about nodes like <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5226349510">this one</a>? Next time please provide a link to your changeset, objects or at leas the area you are referring to.</p>
<p>Nodes with a building tag and name are currently not rendered in OSM. If you want to add a name to a building then add it to the building outline.</p>
<p>Also, creating a building=yes node inside a building outline doesn't make much sense. You are essentially creating a duplicated feature. See <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/One_feature,_one_OSM_element">one feature, one OSM element</a> why this is (almost always) a bad idea.</p>
<p>Please remove this node and similar ones you created. Add the name to the building outlines instead.</p>

<p>I don't know this tutorial. Maybe the tutorial is wrong at some point or ambiguous.</p>
<p>If you want to give different parts of a building a different name then you could split it. However splitting a building should be mainly done to represent a physical separation, e.g. a firewall.</p>
<p>Do these buildings actually have names? Or is there some POI (e.g. a shop) located inside the building? This is a totally different case and the name should then be added to the POI instead.</p>
