<p>I have made about 9,500+ edits in a layer and I forgot how to efficiently upload in chunks (I recently used "2", instead of for example 1,000, in a previous changeset which took several hours to upload), so I uploaded them in a single changeset using only one request thinking it would be quicker.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/62137527">changeset</a> was open for several minutes and was automatically closed after 1 hour. Upon checking on JOSM, the "Uploading data for layer x" dialog is still shown even though the changeset was already closed. To ensure the edits were really uploaded, I checked the changeset at <a href="https://overpass-api.de/achavi/?changeset=62137527">achavi</a> and also at the main OSM page/map, and the changes were indeed uploaded.</p>
<p><img src="https://help.openstreetmap.org/upfiles/osmJosmUpload_IhjGS8C.png" alt="JOSMUploadDialog" /></p>
<p>The JOSM dialog has been displayed for more than an hour now, and I am quite concerned it might have hanged. Should I safely ignore the message and click "Cancel" or should I wait for the dialog to close by itself and the "Upload successful" message to come out?</p>
