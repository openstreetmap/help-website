<p>Humm, I don't understand why my comment is now an answer… I meant that adamblazej issue was fixed, not yours, sorry. And I don't have notifications when someone else comment where I've commented, so I missed your comment saying I'm now editor. I'll now investigate.</p>

<p>An invalid feature has been created with the name "Caf" (actually three features with that same name) and a null geometry. Maybe it's related to the "Cafan" feature ? Anyway, do you remember anything that could help understanding how those invalid features have been created ? So I can provide a fix for later. For this time, I've deleted manually those feature and reimported the layer. Please confirm it's ok.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/4961/ybon">@ybon</a> moderators can change comments to answers and vice versa provided that they haven't been edited. I'm guessing that someone thought that your "Should be fixed, sorry!" applied to the original question :)</p>

<p>Ok, thanks for the explanation :)</p>
<p>Any idea why I do not receive a notification when someone comment after my comment ? I've tried to go in my settings, but I cannot touch those ones. I guess checking "A comment is posted" here would help, but I don't have the checkbox: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/K8RpmOn">https://imgur.com/a/K8RpmOn</a></p>

<p>Wow! The data is indeed back, thank you very much! Unfortunately, I have no idea what could have caused it. I think the conversion of lines to polygons if the shapes were weird didn't always go right, but that wasn't with the Caf IIRC.</p>
<p>Btw, I admire this mapmaking service you guys have created! Cheers!</p>

<p>Re "Any idea why I do not receive a notification when someone comment after my comment ?" it's likely one of two things:</p>
<p>1) You've got it turned off in "notification settings"</p>
<p>2) It's a bug in OSQA.</p>
<p>FWIW I did get a notification about your comment ("ybon has just posted a comment on the answer posted by ybon to the question Umap: Lost data?"). Oddly, the subscriptions that I see for me don't seem to be editable, but presumably I set them when they were.</p>
