Otherwise there can be delays by using the Nagle algorithm or delayed acknowledgements, and if the sending stack knows that there will be no more data to be sent together it might set the PSH flag ("don't wait for more bytes, just process it right away!"). This is also common in time critical applications to avoid latency caused by waiting for more data to bundle together.</p><p>Zero Window can be a bad thing, because it means that the receiver signals that it cannot receive more bytes before it has finished processing the completely filled up buffers first. It's sort of a "stop sending, I need time to work here" message, and that indicates a performance problem on the receivers side. It is not a network problem, it's a problem on the receiving node. Get more RAM, faster Disks, more CPU power, whatever helps.</p><p>"Window Full" is a diagnosis that Wireshark does when it sees that the sender has sent as many bytes as the receiver had announced as free in its buffers. It is basically stated when "Bytes in Flight" a.k.a. "bytes that have not yet been acknowledged" equal the last Window size the receiver advertised. A diagnosis like this can indicate performance problems on the horizon, while Zero Window means that the problem has finally happened.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>29 Nov '13, 04:47</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c578ba2967741f25aebd6afef702f432?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Jasper&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>Jasper ♦♦</span><br />
