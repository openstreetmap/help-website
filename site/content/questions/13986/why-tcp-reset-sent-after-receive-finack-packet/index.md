This means that during a connection close sequence, <em>both</em> sides get to say "I'm done sending things now." The connection isn't "down" until both sides <em>have</em> done that, or one side sends a TCP <code>RST</code> packet.</p><p>It is quite possible — and indeed common — for the connection to be half-closed. For example, a simple HTTP 1.0 conversation is a request for information, followed by a response from the server. The client is free to close its sending half of the connection after the request; it won't affect whether the server sends the reply. HTTP 1.1 can be more complex than this, allowing multiple requests and responses on a single connection, but the old one request per connection style is still legal.</p><p>Looking at your capture, what I see is that the server sends its <code>FIN</code> and <code>ACK</code> bits, and the client responds with a <code>RST</code>. That means the client isn't coded to shut the connection down gracefully. There are many ways for this to happen:</p><ul><li><p>The client can just exit without closing the connection. The stack is free to complete the graceful shutdown for the dead program, but it's likely to just send <code>RST</code> immediately.</p></li><li><p>The client can set the <code>SO_LINGER</code> option with <code>setsockopt()</code> to 0, then exit, leaving the stack no choice but send a <code>RST</code> because both TCP peers are gone and it has been told it isn't allowed to spend any time cleaning up the connection.</p></li><li><p>The client can use non-blocking sockets, call <code>close()</code> on the socket, then exit, thinking it has closed its sending half correctly, not realizing that it is forcing the stack to abort sending in-flight packets, substituting a <code>RST</code>.</p></li><li><p>If the client doesn't abortively exit like above, it may be doing something odd like <code>shutdown(fd, SHUT_RDWR)</code> or <code>shutdown(SHUT_RD)</code>. The first is called "slamming the connection shut," and the second is basically the client telling the server "shut up, you!" Either way, a TCP <code>RST</code> goes out.</p></li></ul><p>Bottom line, the client has a bug, and needs to be fixed.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>02 Sep '12, 15:33</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8b0e3f6ae64ff27a7a01a0f49f8ee469?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Warren%20Young&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>Warren Young</span><br />

The concept is basically that http sessions are short-lived, with a single Req/Resp pair (http 1.0). This special case therefore doesn't require TCP's ability to receive data after a FIN is sent, so after the server is done sending the requested content, the browser will send a RST. This bypasses the CLOSE-WAIT and LAST-ACK states on the browser, and triggers the server to bypass the FIN-WAIT-1/FIN-WAIT-2/CLOSING states.</p><p>Short answer: when dealing with web browsers, this is common behavior.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>04 Dec '13, 16:34</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e6e7efe400de64e0dd5e7e641e695d5f?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="shewfig&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>shewfig</span><br />
