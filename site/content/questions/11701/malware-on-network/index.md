</p></blockquote><ol><li>Sniff on the switch port where your firewall is connected to: <code>http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/Ethernet</code><br />
</li><li>Use this capture filter to reduce traffic: '<code>port 25 and not host a.b.c.d</code>' where '<code>a.b.c.d</code>' is the ip address of your exchange server.</li><li>Stop the capture, if you think there is enough data (or enough 'evidence').</li><li><p>Analyze the traffic by doing this:</p><ul><li>Find all TCP conversations: <code>Statistics -&gt; Conversation List -&gt; TCP</code><br />
</li><li>Sort the entries by source ip or bytes (or any other criteria you are interested in)</li><li>Follow one TCP Stream: select one of those conversations and click the button "Follow Stream"</li><li>Read the content of that TCP stream (e-mail)</li></ul></li><li><p>After you have identified those computers that send unsolicited mails, take them of the network and analyze what is going on (malware scan, asking the user, etc.)</p></li><li><p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Close your firewall !! No computer, other than your exchange server, should be allowed to send mails to the outside. <strong>Furthermore</strong>: Configure your Exchange SMTP connector to accept only authenticated connections (SMTPAUTH). If you don't do that, malware might just use your exchange SMTP connector as a relay to send e-mail to the outside. <strong>Beware!</strong> If you don't do this right, you might break incoming mail. Please ask you local Exchange guru how to configure this feature in the right way!</p></li></ol><p>Regards<br />
