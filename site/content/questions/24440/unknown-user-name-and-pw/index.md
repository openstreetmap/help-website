I think you're better off trying to review the user manual to what the default username and password is and try that. If that fails, there may be a way to reset it back to its factory defaults and then go from there.</p><p>From documents posted at <a href="http://www.shixin-china.com/1074.html">http://www.shixin-china.com/1074.html</a>, it looks like the default username/password might be either admin/admin or admin and no password at all. I did not see a way to reset it to factory defaults, but I may have missed it.

"admin" and some 8-digit hexnumber, example admin and 021abffe.</p><p>There is a same sticker inside case. However these admin and 021abffe (example) may not work if administrator username has changed from "admin" to something or his password has changed. Then it is possible to reset admin/password to these defaults using utility and upgrade firmware. It can also be "upgrade" to same firmware version again. It may ask "device password" and this is passwd from sticker or the one you was told.</p><p>The "utility" and firmware can be found <a href="http://www.shixin-china.com/1074.html">http://www.shixin-china.com/1074.html</a> (has newer firmware) or <a href="http://www.icamview.co.uk/orderonline/Downloads.htm.">http://www.icamview.co.uk/orderonline/Downloads.htm.</a> (has newer "utility")</p><p>Be careful choosing the right firmware. Utility shows cameras current firmware.</p><p>I had same kind of situation with ip-06a except i was not given any username/passwd. Those from sticker did not work. I tried to upgrade firmware to same version which device already had and after that those admin/passwd from sticker worked.</p><p>If there is "device password" changed or used it may be not possible to do anything from outside. Then one option is read firmware from hardware, do some hexediting and write firmware back. Or write new firmware to chip by hardware programmer. These may not work if passwd is in different place.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>09 Dec '13, 15:25</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a22ec72d5af50e2dd9b469d2f6dabffa?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="second_one&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>second_one<br />
