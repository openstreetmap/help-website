<p>A week or so ago someone pointed out to me that Quarry House, Leeds, UK was missing. It is a big building in Leeds and should be at <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/53.79827/-1.53076">https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/53.79827/-1.53076</a>. I went into edit mode and found there was a building drawn at the location so I assumed it had been recently added. After a day or so it still hadn't shown up on <em>any</em> of the layers. I tried redrawing it myself but it still refuses to appear. I realise that it takes time for the map tiles to update but it has been many days now. All other edits I've done in the city have shown up within a matter of minutes on at least one layer or other. Have I done something wrong? Could there be a block on showing it because it is a government building?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Thanks Ed for spotting that. I thought it had started with one so it must have lost it when I connected the various parts.</p>

<p>i faced the same problem when i created a building in JOSM. I used the PRESET to set the type of building. Preset used was Transport -&gt; Airport -&gt; Hanger</p>
<p>This will set the tags with following values- building : hanger/ name: hanger A</p>
<p>When i open the map in Maperitive, it doesn't show this building. However when i change the value of tag 'building' to Yes, it shows the building.</p>
<p>If i create a building in OpenStreetMap.org with tags building: hanger, its displayed.</p>

<p>No, that's a completely different problem. The original problem has been about a completely missing building tag. In your case the building tag is present, but Maperitive doesn't seem to handle the value hangar correctly (please note it's hang<em>a</em>r, not hang<em>e</em>r). If this is still a problem for you then please create a new question. But don't change the tag in OSM, building=hangar is correct.</p>
