I have tried to use programs and features (1st attempt to remove) Which then led me to a google search. I then tried to use the uninstall.exe in the wireshark directory with run as Administrator. Same error (rawshark.exe) I then tried the suggestion to manually delete rawshark.exe. That file was not found anywhere. But yet running the uninstall still fails with the error stating rawshark can not be removed it is in use etc. I have rebooted and still the same results. Any other ideas are greatly appreciated.</p></div><div id="comment-53903-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(07 Jul '16, 07:21)</span> JohnO</div></div><span id="53904"></span><div id="comment-53904" class="comment"><div id="post-53904-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Can you show the exact error message?</p></div><div id="comment-53904-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(07 Jul '16, 07:30)</span> grahamb ♦</div></div><span id="53937"></span><div id="comment-53937" class="comment"><div id="post-53937-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Do you have <a href="https://ask.wireshark.org/questions/27855/cant-uninstall-wireshark-on-win8-64bit">zonealarm</a> installed?</p></div><div id="comment-53937-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(08 Jul '16, 07:25)</span> cmaynard ♦♦</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-53860" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-53860-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
