<p>I removed a nearby school from OSM after it was torn down. Now it has been rebuilt in a different sit on the property. I walked the perimeter of the building and recorded a track and some corner WPs, combined the 2 and submitted the gpx as a GPS trace, which was accepted. Now after multiple attempts at incorporating the data into OSM I am unable to proceed with either iD or Potlach.</p>
<p>Is there a way someone could walk me through the process using my GPS Trace? I would be grateful to learn how to do it as I am getting nowhere as is. Fred</p>

<p>You should simply drag and drop the GPX file in / on to iD and then draw an "area" following its outline. tag that as building=school and potentially add an amenity=school covering the actual school ground with name and so on, and you are done.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help Simon. I sucessfully dropped the gpx file into iD &gt; drew an outline &gt; shape turned to a pulsing orange-red as if active. Now I am stuck as to how to label it as, under Select feature type/Building Features, there is no "school", at least that I can find.</p>

<p>Simply search for "school" you should then get an entry "School Building". Otherwise go to "All tags" and press the "+" button and add an entry with key building, value school.</p>

<p>Hi, just to help with the drawing. In Potlatch2 and iD editors the Esri World Imagery (selected from the background dropdown box), has the school in view, it seems to match your gpx trace.</p>
<p>Esri World Imagery (Clarity) Beta seems to have an older image of the school.</p>
<p>With your knowledge from walking the area you can choose the current aerial imagery and thus from the image and gpx trace draw a precise outline.</p>

<p>BCNorwich, your finding that satellite image of the new building was the answer because the building is very complex in shape and my trace was difficult to interpret. The school just opened in Jan. and they are still working on the grounds. Now I am trying to figure out how to remove the redundant name "Hamlin Middle School" which sits belos the new building. Also I note the old school to the south appears in some projections and needs to be removed so I am going to have to learn how to do that.</p>

<p>I'll recommend removing the name from the building you just created and leave the name on the schoolgrounds</p>
