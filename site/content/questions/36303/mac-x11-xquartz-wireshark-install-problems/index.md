Is there anyone who could help troubleshoot this with me? I have downloaded and installed XQuartz for the purposes of having X11, which Wireshark said it required. That didn't work. I uninstalled and reinstalled both XQuartz and Wireshark. That didn't work. I don't have much programming experience, so some of the scripts I've seen may work, but perhaps I'm running them incorrectly? Basically I'm at the end of my rope, and I really need to get this done by tomorrow (Sunday, the 14th of September, 2014).
