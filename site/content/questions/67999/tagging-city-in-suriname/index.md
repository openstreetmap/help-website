<p>I'm living in Suriname, where there are adresses that are not connected to cities or villages. That is because the country is divded in districts. If an adress is not in a city or village, it is in the district. I will give an example: The street I live in is not in a city or village. It is in the district of Wanica, Suriname. It should be: Jovende Sawayweg, Wanica. I tagged my own address so in OSM. However, in OSMAND you cannot find it there. If you search it there, you find it is in Paramaribo, which is the nearest city. Is it possible to tag adresses in the countryside so, that it is not automatically tagged to the nearest city? Or is it an OSMAND problem, not looking at the city tag?</p>
