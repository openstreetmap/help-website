<table style="width:100%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 50%" /><col style="width: 50%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="width: 30px; vertical-align: top"><div class="vote-buttons"><div id="post-60821-score" class="post-score" title="current number of votes">2</div></div></td><td><div class="item-right"><div class="answer-body"><p>I always recommend going for the instructor lead option, because you can't ask printed materials or videos any questions. Sometimes that's the difference between getting the idea and getting stuck. So if you can go to Laura's intro class plus the conference you have tons of opportunities to ask questions to trainers, speakers, and other conference attendees with analysis skills. And Sharkfest is an amazing conference in the way that it is small and not as anonymous as the big conferences. It's easy to mingle and you really can talk to anyone. The speakers, which are all packet analysis experts, are also always happy to help.</p><p>If you can only do one I would probably recommend Laura's class (or any instructor led Wireshark training), because it's a structured way to learn. Conference talks are great, too, of course, but they're 1-2 hour topics that are going to handle specific topics. Depending on your skill level you may get some great information, or it could go over your head. A look at the Agenda can give you an idea what's going to happen, and Youtube has a ton of talk videos from previous conferences, so you can check if that kind of thing suits you.</p><p>Working with books or video material is pretty dry, so it requires a lot of self discipline to get through. If you want to go that way I can highly recommend getting yourself some IT equipment (PC, Server, manageable switch, Capture Laptop) to experiment with real things and not just reading text all the time. I usually experiment a lot and when I don't understand what's happening I read up on what I need to know.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>13 Apr '17, 14:06</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c578ba2967741f25aebd6afef702f432?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Jasper&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Jasper ♦♦<br />
