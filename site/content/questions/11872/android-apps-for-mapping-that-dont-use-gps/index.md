<p>Currently I'm using a Samsung GSII to make GPX files of unmapped streets and alleyways in Hanoi.</p>
<p>My problem is that in Hanoi there are a lot of narrow alleyways surrounded by 4-6 story buildings, and the GPS can't get closer than 50m accuracy in these conditions. I end up doing more guesswork than I'd like when I'm mapping the alleyways.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any Android apps that combine pedometers and a compass to make approximate traces of walking without using the GPS?</strong> It needn't be perfect - it would just allow me to get a combination of aerial photography, GPS and this to get a better guess of the alleyways.</p>

<p>With some GPS devices (Vista HCX for example) you can get it to take a number of readings and average a point, so maybe if the alleys are straight using a point got from open areas at the ends could work, or a compass bearing from one. One way to get an average with an android is to stay still for a while and the resulting blob in the trace is an average.</p>

<p>That'll help, but with tall buildings and (I'm assuming) no EGNOS equivalent in Hanoi, an "averaged" point may still be displaced to one side. The "if you can, draw a straight line between points in open areas" idea that you mention is probably the best idea available.</p>

<p>Taking an accurate measurement at both ends works for some alleys, but you can get an idea of the complexity of some areas by looking at this section: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=21.03863&amp;lon=105.8198&amp;zoom=17&amp;layers=M">https://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=21.03863&amp;lon=105.8198&amp;zoom=17&amp;layers=M</a> . (I didn't map these, but I've checked a few of them out for accuracy, and they seem to be largely right.)</p>

<p>I do remember someone posting "maps" of a US university that they'd done this way on either one of the OSM lists or IRC channels - the results were better than I'd have expected. A quick web search doesn't find exactly that example, but does turn up <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22android%22+%22dead+reckoning%22+-game+-%22walking+dead%22+mapping+&amp;btnG=Search&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;client=firefox-a">some possible answers</a> to your question.</p>

<p>Thanks for this. It looks like this is a common problem for car GPS navigation, and with a fairly brief look, it seems there aren't any apps. These seem to be looking at using the accelerometer to sense turns in the car. I'll keep looking, but this is a nice lead...</p>
