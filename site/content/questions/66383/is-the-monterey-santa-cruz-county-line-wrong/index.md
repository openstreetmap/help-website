<p>I asked this question a while ago and never got any answers. I'm surprised none of the map mavens out there have an answer for me!</p>
<p>A friend of mine says the Monterey/Santa Cruz county line in openstreets 3 miles out to sea that travels from the mouth of the pajaro river to the north south california boundary line is wrong. In openstreetsmap the line travels west, south, west. My friend says the line should travel directly west.</p>

<p>I think openstreets is correct, but how did open streets come up with the boundary?</p>
<p>I know someone knows the answer!</p>
<p>I love openstreets map!</p>
<p>I have a friend who says the openstreets map county line between Monterey and Santa Cruz is wrong according to a 1927 California Supreme Court Ruling. I believe open streets! Please let me know if the comments below are correct</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>Official boundaries of Monterey-Santa Cruz, as determined by the California Supreme Court in Ocean Industries v. Superior Court of California, in and for Santa Cruz County (1927) 200 Cal. 235. The decision held that Monterey Bay as a "closed bay" under law, and there is treated as if it were land for purposes of State and County jurisdiction -- which, in the case, held that Santa Cruz County could enforce fishing regulations in SCZ waters in Monterey Bay more than 3 miles offshore.</p>
<p>I have a longish discussion at <a href="http://creagrus.home.montereybay.com/MtyBay-boundaries.html">http://creagrus.home.montereybay.com/MtyBay-boundaries.html</a></p>
<p>Government Code section 23127 defines Monterey County as "beginning in the Pacific Ocean, at the southwest corner of Santa Cruz [County]; thence east to the mouth of the Pajaro River". Likewise, section 23144 defines Santa Cruz County, in pertinent part, as "westerly along said [Pajaro] River" along the northern line of San Benito and Monterey "to the Bay of Monterey, and three miles westerly into the ocean."</p>
<p>The openstreet map shows a line across Monterey Bay in this tiny sliver of the Bay that runs not "west-east" but about WSW-ENE and connects up with the "nearest point of land" line at the 3 mile limit west of Monterey Bay.</p>

<p>This is likely the wrong place for such a question. I would suggest asking it on the <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-us">US talk mailing</a> list, where local knowledgable contributors can weigh in and the pros and cons can be discussed (this is not a discussion site to start with).</p>
<p>PS it is OpenStreetMap no s, not openstreets, or anything else.</p>
