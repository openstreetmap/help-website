<p>I imagine not. Deleted users have requested that personal details, email etc be removed from by system administrators. As I understand it this involves removal of diary entries, and some anonymisation of contributed GPS traces as well. All that is left are the numeric user_id and a name generated from that.</p>
<p>Given that to be deleted requires a significant statement of intent, I think it is only courteous not to try to identify them and contact them.</p>
<p>Furthermore in the future old usernames etc are unlikely to be available in full and history downloads (see recent discussions regarding GDPR).</p>

<p>I only noticed now that his UID is being used as a suffix to the last used username. To make it more obvious that a user has been removed a name like removed_user_123456 would be more helpful ;)</p>
