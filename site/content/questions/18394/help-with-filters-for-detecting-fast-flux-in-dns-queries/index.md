Why do you think <strong>your</strong> name servers are beeing used?</p><p>DNS fast flux works by adding a huge number of A records for a FQDN and changing them quickly, as well as changing NS records. Both <strong>should</strong> be impossible with <strong>your name server</strong>, otherwise somebody has control over your server and then you have a bigger problem than just dns fast flux ;-)</p><p>Now for the way to detect dns fast flux:</p><p>If you search google you will find a lot of papers. The common strategy is to count the number of A records for a FQDN and monitor changes of those A records in different answers for a query. If those two take place, it's most likely dns fast flux, with some possibility for false positives (e.g. pool.ntp.org and similar).</p><p>So, what you need is the dns query name (FQDN), all A records of the answer and a history of NS answers (A records) to monitor any changes.</p><p>With tshark this is would be:</p><blockquote><p><code>tshark -nr dns_only.pcap -R "dns.resp.type ==1" -T fields -e ip.src -e dns.qry.name -e dns.resp.addr -E occurrence=a -E separator=;</code></p></blockquote><p>Sample Output:</p><pre><code>   192.168.158.2;www.google.de;173.194.44.56,173.194.44.63,173.194.44.55
   192.168.158.2;www.microsoft.com;64.4.11.42
   192.168.158.2;ask.wireshark.org;174.137.42.77
   192.168.158.2;divewithsharks.hk;70.68.187.999,76.209.81.999,85.207.74.999</code></pre><p>The sample <strong>divewithsharks.hk</strong> is a real world sample (<a href="http://www.honeynet.org/node/138">honeynet.org</a>) of dns fast flux with modified last octet.</p><p>Then you need a script (perl, python, whatever) to analyze the output of tshark, as described above. Obviously you can 'enrich' the output with DNS TTL, frame time, etc. But that's not really necessary just to <strong>detect</strong> fast flux. If you need a history and some time analysis, then the frame time would be helpful (-e frame.time).</p><p>Good luck!</p><p><strong>**UPDATE**</strong><br />
I recently found this tool: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dns-mole/">http://code.google.com/p/dns-mole/</a></p><p>Regards<br />

They are separated with a Comma so i set the rest to be determinated with commas so that when i import it into my sql database it can detect the separate columns. The issue is that it only separates the first 4 addresses then doesn't bother separating the rest and checks them into 1 column.
