<p>If I understand you correctly, and I'm not sure that I do, I'd just map these as garages. Presumably the apartment is used as guest accommodation or a granny annex. These exist in the UK too, often on older properties where the garage would have originally been a coach house &amp; the area above would have provided housing for the coachman.</p>
