This seems to work fine with capture filter syntax ( -f "ip src W.X.Y.Z ). However, at least in 1.4, I am unable to load a default display filter by command line ( -R "ip.addr==W.X.Y.Z" ). I know this is in the "processing" parameter. However, unlike resolution, it seems to only work when pulling a file in with ( -R &lt;filename&gt; ). It may be by design. I hope someone has an answer for you.</p></div><div id="comment-1265-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(06 Dec '10, 17:21)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Paul Stewart</span></div></div><span id="3201"></span><div id="comment-3201" class="comment"><div id="post-3201-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>In theory, "-R filter_expression" could be used to automatically apply a display filter, but I don't know enough about gtk programming to know for sure or to be able to implement this myself. You might want to file an enhancement bug request for this at https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/, and if it's possible and if there's sufficient interest, perhaps someone will implement it for you.</p></div><div id="comment-3201-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(29 Mar '11, 07:44)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">cmaynard ♦♦</span></div></div><span id="3233"></span><div id="comment-3233" class="comment"><div id="post-3233-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Actually, "-R filter_expression" adds a <em>read</em> filter, which, when you read the file in, discards packets that don't match; that means that you can't then <em>change</em> the filter within the same Wireshark session, e.g. remove it and see all the packets. This may or may not be what the person who asked the original question wants.</p></div><div id="comment-3233-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(30 Mar '11, 10:26)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Guy Harris ♦♦</span></div></div><span id="3274"></span><div id="comment-3274" class="comment"><div id="post-3274-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Right, that's the behavior of "-R" when reading a capture file. When starting Wireshark from the command-line but not reading a capture file, then "-R" is currently ignored. I was throwing out the idea that "-R"'s behavior could possibly be modified to meet the needs of the OP. (Either that, or a new option could be added, but since "-R" is not used in that case anyway, I thought it could be, which would avoid having to add another option.)</p></div><div id="comment-3274-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(01 Apr '11, 08:12)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">cmaynard ♦♦</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-1264" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-1264-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
