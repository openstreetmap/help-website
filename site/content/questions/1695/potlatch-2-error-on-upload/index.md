<p>At present there's a bug where, if you delete a way where part of it is off-screen, then save, this will throw an error. We're trying to fix this urgently but it may require an API change.</p>

<p>I just got the error as well with a moderate size update. Editing existing paths, adding new paths with connections, drag dropping viewpoint icons, and changing name of polygon layer. Leaving browser open till advice, I don't want to loose all the updates...</p>
<p>I may have deleted some ways that had nodes off screen. Any idea on when this may be fixed? I know it is probably a pain to fix given that it is a server API issue from what I read, but it would be very helpful.</p>

<p>This is what happens when the server refuses to process the upload. There are a few ways that this can be caused, and we've been working on tracking them down, but flash player doesn't pass on the responses when there's an error so it's quite hard for P2 to handle properly.</p>
<p>The most common one is to try deleting a road which leads off the edge of your screen - you should check the whole length before deleting the road.</p>
<p>Some of the potential solutions we've come up with require server-side changes too, so things are still in progress and are being developed.</p>

<p>I've just managed to get round this error for the first time.‡ :)</p>
<p>I tried saving from Potlatch 2 and got the dreaded "Couldn't upload data: 0 Error #2032". I tried re-saving a couple of times but got the same error.</p>
<p>However, I then pressed 'C', which is supposed to 'close' a changeset. It gave me an error to the effect that it couldn't close the changeset, but guess what? When I tried to save again, it went through. My changes were saved successfully and have been rendered in Mapnik already.</p>
<p>Hope this workaround helps others, but I <em>really</em> hope this bug gets squashed a.s.a.p.</p>
<hr />
<p>‡ Very glad of it too, because not only have I just spent 45 minutes editing without saving, I've also been deleting the waypoints from my GPS as I entered them all into Potlatch, so I'd have been <strong>really</strong> annoyed if I'd lost all the surveying time as well.</p>

<p>We can't fix the bug without knowing what triggers it. If you can provide consistent steps to reproduce it (or even a hint as to what might cause it), that's great. But otherwise there's really not much that we can do. It's not a bug I've ever encountered.</p>
<p>Please please please don't leave it 45 minutes between saves. Potlatch 2 is a very young yet very complex piece of software. There are inevitably going to be bugs. Please save every five minutes at least.</p>

<p>If I were to guess (and this really is a complete guess) I'd say that the most likely place to look for something like this is in the undo, redo and cancel behaviour. Certainly, when observing Potlatch users before, I've noticed that they might use undo and cancel in very different ways to the way I'm used to; and undo is a complex operation at any rate.</p>
