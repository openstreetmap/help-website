In parallel, you may file another bug, asking for mere correction of what you consider a wrong display (showing just <code>1</code> instead of <code>01</code>)</p><p>For the moment, you'll have to use a post-process (script) to achieve your goal.</p><p>But I wonder whether it is really possible that the mnc value would be just a single nibble in size?

We are now looking for another solution and approach. We have been working on a solution and have even designed our own internal one (kind of a result modifier - still just a concept), but we are not sure if this is something useful for the community and wanted to see if someone else knows about an already implemented solution and also ask for feedback. As we are not sure if this is something, which is already available, we thought asking about it would be better than requesting an existing feature. Yes, 1 and 01 are mathematically the same, but technically not. If a 1-digit MNC value is presented in the traffic, it might be considered an erroneous entity, as MNC should be 2 digits (and in newer versions I believe even 3 digits) long. So the semantic interpretation is different.</p></div><div id="comment-53850-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(06 Jul '16, 00:55)</span> arashdalir</div></div><span id="53977"></span><div id="comment-53977" class="comment"><div id="post-53977-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>As per Sindy's suggestion, I've created the following enhancement request in bugzilla: <a href="https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12606">https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12606</a></p></div><div id="comment-53977-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(11 Jul '16, 02:56)</span> arashdalir</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-53825" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-53825-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
