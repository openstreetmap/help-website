<p>I recently tried to map an area in which a double railway was in a cutting of the land, in fact a cutting in the rock basement. As it is a double railway, I can't map the section of each railway as <code>cutting=yes</code>. In fact, I was wondering: on the <a href="http://forum.openstreetmap.fr/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=2114">French OSM forum</a>, I was told to use a reversed <code>man_made=embankment</code>, which seems to give the good rendering, but that sounds like mapping for the renderer to me. Isn't there a better way to map an artificial cutting with several ways in it? Besides, when a cliff is from a human modelling of the pre-existing land, should I map it as <code>natural=cliff</code>, even if it isn't really a natural feature? If so, is there a mean to highlight its artificial nature?</p>

<p>I would tag each of the two railway lines as <code>cutting=left</code> or <code>cutting=right</code>, depending on the direction of each way. In other words, if the way representing a railway line is on the left side of the cut (as seen in the direction of the way), tag it with <code>cutting=left</code>.</p>

<p>Hmmm... That would do it. I suppose that also answers to the question of distinguishing natural and man-made cuttings. Thank you very much, Lightsider. A shame JOSM and Mapnik don't render cuttings, either on a side or only <code>cutting=yes</code>; do you happen to know how to configure JOSM to render cuttings?</p>

<p>In JOSM you can use different map paint styles (<a href="http://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Styles">http://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Styles</a> ) to render features in different ways. Unfortunately I don't know if any of the existing styles renders cuttings; as a last resort, you can always create your own (there are instructions on the page I linked to).</p>
