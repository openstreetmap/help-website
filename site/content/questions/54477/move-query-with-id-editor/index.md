<p>I raised an edit via my phone to try and move an item, I did this via a descriptive note on the update, I see the change has been closed but the "move" hasn't been actioned so I thought I'd try via my web browser.</p>
<p>As I understand it the default editor is iD from a browser and I checked thru the Beginner's Guide but don't find an answer !</p>
<p>The location on OpenStreetMap is :- <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/385275126">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/385275126</a> The pub (Cutlers Arms) is misplaced, it should be immediately north of Burrell Street.</p>
<p>The issue is (I believe) that the current abject is a bui8lding rather than a point. That is I can see how to move the "feature" but that moves the whole building and the building (although now demolished !) is not the problem, it's the building description that is in error. There appears to be a "point" named Cutlers Arms and all its attributes are valid so I don't want to delete it, can someone advise what is the best way to move this point across the road ?</p>
