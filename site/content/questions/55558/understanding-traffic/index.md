I also use PeerBlock, where I will manually enter in various IP's that I want blocked. The image below contains a copy of the traffic that "bothers" me, and also includes a snippet of the router log file.</p><p><img src="https://osqa-ask.wireshark.org/upfiles/port2323_wireshark.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p><p>The router log initially shows a rejected incoming packet on port 23, immediately followed by a processed packet from the same IP on port 2323 and an outgoing response. I'm not sure why the router is allowing this to happen in the first place but... I find that I am getting a LOT of "queries" going to this port 2323 and they all seem to get processed. Most seem to be coming from places in Brazil, and I can't seem to stop them.</p><p>Any suggestions? And yes, I have done full AV and malware scans using many different highly rated programs all with the latest definitions, and nothing has been found.</p><p>Thanks kindly in advance :)</p><p>Gary</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">badtraffic</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>14 Sep '16, 09:50</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/639c4d7df18c5e53f8b3d33264f55d37?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="GaryM&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>GaryM<br />
