<p>I used JOSM 12712 for some edits and then I tried to save them. JOSM didn't complain, but it was stuck in an infinite loop of "I'm currently uploading the changes". Since it wasn't completed after like 5 minutes and it was late I decided to let the computer run and close JOSM the next morning.</p>
<p>However, the upload was still running the next morning. When I looked into my changeset list, I noticed that JOSM created the changeset (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/52778088)">https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/52778088)</a> but there were no changes in them. I abborted the upload (it was like 8+ hours since I started the upload). I tried to play around with the settings, reload the map data and tried to push it to the same changeset. It didn't work again. Since I tried to push it to the same changeset all the time (which was maybe closed by the server in the mean time?) I tried to upload the changes to a new changeset (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/52779207).">https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/52779207).</a> I had the same problem again. The changeset was created, but there were no changes in them.</p>
<p>The solution to this was to save the changes and restart JOSM. I imported the changeset data and pushed it to the server. This time it worked.</p>
<p><strong>The question:</strong> Now there are two empty changesets which aren't even visible from the profile page which don't serve any purpose. Is it possible to delete them?</p>
