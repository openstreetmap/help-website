The SSLKEYLOGFILE env variable gives you the master secret, but I don't think that's sufficient/useful with DH. It's only useful with RSA, as far as I can recall.

I have taken a look at fiddler. However I would prefer to decrypt the capture directly in Wireshark rather than setting up a MITM proxy. This seems to be preferable to me since it cuts out the middleman ;) so to speak.</p><p>When security.tls.version.max=1 is set in the about:config page in firefox, then TLSv1.0, cipher TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA was used by <a href="https://www.google.co.uk">https://www.google.co.uk</a>. (I closed both Wireshark and firefox and restarted them after making changes to this setting.) This was decrypted by Wireshark and it looks as if this cipher uses forward secrecy e.g. <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4492">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4492</a> states "the ECDHE_ECDSA and ECDHE_RSA key exchange algorithms provide forward secrecy protection in the event of server key compromise" and <a href="https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/06/25/ssl-labs-deploying-forward-secrecy">https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/06/25/ssl-labs-deploying-forward-secrecy</a> states "Configuring Forward Secrecy...In the nutshell, these are some of the suites you might want to enable3 and push (close) to the top: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA"</p><p>As you said SSLKEYLOGFILE env variable gives the master secret (as per <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/NSS_Key_Log_Format)">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/NSS_Key_Log_Format)</a> i.e. CLIENT_RANDOM space 64 bytes of hex encoded client_random space 96 bytes of hex encoded master secret. However I am presuming that this is the master secret which can be used to derive the session key (c.f. <a href="http://ask.wireshark.org/questions/21011/decrypting-tls-messages-which-is-using-diffie-hellman-algorithm).">http://ask.wireshark.org/questions/21011/decrypting-tls-messages-which-is-using-diffie-hellman-algorithm).</a> With TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA the lines "found master secret in key log" and "dissect_ssl3_hnd_srv_hello found CIPHER 0XC011 -&gt; state 0x37" followed by generation of the plaintext appear in the log file chosen in the "SSL debug file" field. With TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 the line "found master secret in key log" also appears but is however followed by "dissect_ssl3_hnd_srv_hello can't find cipher suite 0xC02F".</p><p>This makes me think together with <a href="https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6688">https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6688</a> that it might be that Wireshark does not support these particular ciphers?
