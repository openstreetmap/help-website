<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I am new here and I am editing a video and I am going to publish it first in Youtube. The video is possibly going to include a modified still image of OSM. If the video get enough publicity and a tv company wants to show it etc. How does the licence go with these cases of the still image of OSM?</p>
<p>Thanks! P-K-H</p>
<p>I explain my question a little further. Video has closing credits and I am going to put OSM there, but what I am thinking is how the licence goes with a still picture. Is it so that the modified still is open data in all cases?</p>

<p>What I have read that all the other part of the work is my copyright. What if after publishing in Youtube a tv-channel wants to buy my film, how it is with that OSM still then?</p>

<p>Licence terms changed slightly in April. You should now be looking at ODbl <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/">http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/</a></p>
<p>Concerning the credits, I think either the tv channel should screen your video in its entirety (including your own credits with OSM) or if it is screening extracts along with other material, should incorporate the OSM credit into its own credits for the program.</p>
<p>This leaves the question of whether you created any "modified data" as part of the still image, which you might need to publish. But for anybody to comment on that, I think you would need to give more information about how that image would be created.</p>
