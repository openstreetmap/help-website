<p>I have looked to see if anyone has applied additional tags to identify these bins, unfortunately the only things named "Big Belly" appear to be a kebab takeways in <span>Cluj</span> and <span>Arad</span>. Apart from <code>operator=Big Belly</code>, what other tags are suggested to discriminate these from other ordinary <code>amenity=waste_basket</code> facilities?</p>

<p>I don't feel that these are far enough from a waste basket in terms of expectation or function to differentiate, and <code>amenity=waste_basket</code> is almost certainly the most applicable tag. It's a place you can throw stuff away, and roughly the same size as a traditional city wastebasket (but much smaller than the giant concrete ones used in theft-prone cities like Portland to keep people from stealing the wastebasket).</p>
<p>I'm not sure Big Belly actually operates these cans, I'm pretty sure they just make 'em, and I'm not sure the brand of wastebasket matters much. When was the last time you needed to throw something away and was like, "Nope, I only use Rubbermaid wastebaskets?"</p>
<p>That said, they have these in Portland, too, which elicits reactions of "Oh, well, it's never sunny here, so no wonder it's overflowing" and "why would you want to compact the sun?"</p>

<p>Obviously I wasnt clear. I had no intention to tag them anything other than amenity=wastebasket as the basic tag. However, it seems natural to want to separate these out from a simple wastebasket. I was looking for things like how to tag an amenity as solar powered (applies to parking ticket machines, road signs etc), and perhaps are networked, but certainly ones that compact the rubbish. The Nottingham link does actually name the company they are leased from, so brand=Big Belly seems better than operator.</p>

<p><span></span><span>@SK53</span>: what about something more general (as opposed to brand which only helps people knowing that brand)? Maybe the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> and <code>colour</code>? Those may be useful for navigation. Is there anything special for the users of this waste basket? Maybe those tend to have free space more frequently than ordinary waste baskets (due to big capacity and smart emptying)? Well, or the recycling compartment. So some <span>recycling tags</span> may be applicable.</p>

<p>width, height &amp; colour are really too fine a level of detail. In the end I went with brand=Big Belly, operator=whoever, solar_powered=yes, rubbish_compactor=yes. This brand seem to more or less have a monopoly.</p>

<p><span></span><span>@SK53</span>: Whyever the brand name should be not "too fine level of detail" ... ;-) Well, some people collect base ball cards, others brands of waste baskets (really, OSM is a world of collectors). Maybe I did not explain well enough why I think "brand" is not a that useful idea. However, okay now. Great that those get added <em>somehow</em> and with some level of details.</p>
