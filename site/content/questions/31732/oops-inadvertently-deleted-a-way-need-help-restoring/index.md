<p>Hmm, I would like to avoid to half-manually dig/search/browse in the data to find our what and why you did. Do I understand it right that you do not want your full changeset to be reverted? This would be quite easy.</p>

<p>well, okay, thanks for the info. I will have a look... Whyever, having some conflicts. Trying to revert (BCNorwich) and also your subsequent "added track" and "added highway=track" edits before does not create conflicts. Means: Easy (except having spent 30 minutes on this now) to revert all. But I still do not understand what is happening here. Maybe it is too late. I have edited nothing now.</p>

<p>Hi flockfinder, I found the break in the relation ways and have fixed that, looks OK now. That now leaves your other editing intact. If you are happy with your edits then alls well.</p>
<p>It was a case of going round the boundary till you locate the break. With un-delete or reverting there is always the possibility of making things worse, so check the easy way first.</p>
<p>Regards Bernard</p>

<p>BCNorwich, I'm pretty sure what you did was incorrect, sorry. You only added one node, but flockfinder's edit destroyed hundreds of nodes.</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="http://osm.mapki.com/history/relation.php?id=207472">deep diff</a> for this relation, I see that way 39297918 was originally much longer (<a href="http://osm.mapki.com/history/way.php?id=39297918">many points have been deleted</a>). And way 39297877 (which was replaced by 267586993) was longer than 267586993 is now.</p>
<p>I think I can recover the deleted 39297877 using Potlatch 1. However, I don't know how to revert way 39297918 to its previous version. Does anyone know how to do that?</p>

<p>Thanks Eric22. You are correct. The wilderness boundary was along several miles of road. For some reason, I thought that the relation was simply the road bed as opposed to the wilderness boundary. So my rationale was to draw the road in place of the roadbed. It was only after I deleted did it become apparent that it was the wilderness boundary. I am looking on studiously to learn how the get resolved. Again very sorry.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I closed the window with the output from the revert script. I'm not entirely sure what you mean by conflicts. I do think I remember seeing a message saying that it tried to delete certain points but wasn't able to - unclear to me if this indicates a problem. However, other than that, it seemed to run successfully. And now when I open the relevant area, everything seems to be correct.</p>

<p>"wasn't able to" sounds like this, yes. Conflict means that the data on the server is not in the version which you try to use as the starting point in your edit. See <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Help/Concepts/Conflict">JOSM: conflicts</a> (this is just the description for JOSM, this also happens for all other editing software).</p>
<p>Sadly, really understanding changesets is still hard (at least for me), despite we have such great tools like OSMHV.</p>
