<p>We're a 'car sharing' company, formally. I saw the tags for <code>amenity=car_sharing</code> in the help area, but I'm not sure the best way to proceed.</p>
<p>Is there anything specific I can do to help OSM developers leverage my location data to incorporated into maps?</p>
<p>The simplest version of the data I have is simply latitude, longitude and location name.</p>

<p>Thank you for your offer and interest in OpenStreetMap! There are several options to <span>make use of your data (import)</span>.</p>
<p>I think it would be best if you would have a look at the linked import page and then <span>start a new forum thread</span> (or mailing list thread, if you prefer) to discuss the specifics. This is better since this help site is not suited/intended for discussion and longer, highly specific topics. Please mention the link to the forum/ML post once you have did it (for others finding the topic here and wanting to read on). Answers (or clarification inside your text) to the following questions should be included.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have location data of each of your car sharing stations which you would like to see incorporated into OSM, right? So everybody can use/see it. E.g. on the many <span>OSM-based</span> maps.</li>
<li>How was that location data generated (what is the source of these positions? e.g. looked on a map or sat picture to derive the position?)? We have strict licensing requirements (to keep our data <span>free</span> and hence not all sources are usable.</li>
<li>Under which license do you want to offer the data?</li>
<li>How accurate are the positions?<br />
</li>
<li>Do you want to just dump the data somewhere (to be used by helpers) or do you want to also invest work/time to correctly integrate (maybe correcting/adjusting positions of your positions or the positions of the surrounding OSM data, de-duplicating with pre-existing data, …) this data into our database, which is very important (there is no "OSM developer" regarding the geodata – <span>we are crowd-sourced</span>.</li>
<li>Since you originally mentioned "api" as a tag … one should think about how future updates to this dataset can be managed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to <span>other, previous, questions about imports</span> (e.g. <a href="/questions/4936/">how-can-i-import-pois-from-a-postgis-database</a>) can be helpful too, of course.</p>
