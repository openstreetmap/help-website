I have a botnet traffic pcap files mixed with normal traffic. The name of the dataset is CTU 13 DATASET, I need to understand comprehensively “how each machine infected and become bo t” . I know to right way however how can I implement it I am not sure yet, I need to search files that are downloaded to the malicious websites accessed payload content in the information column of pcap files. Especially, in this part definitely I need ideas because need to choose features then extract them via “tshark” or something like that and then I can implement them on machine learning software. Well I am not completely sure but if I understood rightly, need to focus on “Info”. I thought if I consider spesific word in packet like website name and focus on” frame contains -website name-” I can extract the files, do you think is it right approach? However, if it is right approach, I need to form normal/threat column as you see in image, but I am not sure how can I identify them as a threat or normal utilizing info? Because I need to write formula for this like, for length, length&lt;1000: normal, lenght=&gt;1000.</p><p><a href="http://mcfp.weebly.com/the-ctu-13-dataset-a-labeled-dataset-with-botnet-normal-and-background-traffic.html">This is the link to the datasets</a>.</p><p>After this process, using tshark or I can convert into the file txt format and using any programming language I need to extract features, then implement them on machine learning software. However, addition to wireshark general features I also need to create a "normal or threat" column in csv format then I can implement it on machine learning software.</p><p>If you have any alternative idea, I would like to read as well.

The <code>Info</code> column of the packet list provides just a summary information chosen by the author of the dissector of the topmost layer protocol. So for tcp packets which transport http payload, <code>Info</code> contains http-related information, while for tcp packets carrying no payload, <code>Info</code> contains tcp-related information.</p><p>What else to do depends on your actual task. If your goal is to teach the automated system to recognize the characteristic patterns from that particular trace set in a real life traffic, you need to analyse at different layers, not necessarily only the payload ones. If your goal is to define a set of rules allowing the automated system to detect <strong>any</strong> traffic similar to malware one, that's a much more complex task.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>03 Aug '17, 05:25</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/00fc6e2633725bd871ff636f0175eabc?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="sindy&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>sindy</span><br />
