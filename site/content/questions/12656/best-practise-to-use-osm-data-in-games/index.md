<p>Is there really a way to use osm-data in games that comply the odbl?</p>
<p>I will try to play this through using the example of a "virtual" game:"Simcity OSM" and Mark questions with Qn:</p>
<p>Let's say the game should use only street,river and rail-data and the task of the game would be to build up a new city based on the given osm-data.</p>
<p>Workflow: 1) I build a converter that takes osm-data and produces the reduced data (filtering streets,rails,rivers and mapping to my own coordinate-system). Since this already is a derivate this data is under odbl again. There seems to be two options:</p>
<p>a)provide the data as data-files</p>
<p>b)provide the converter that produces the filtered data in readable-form (e.g. xml)</p>
<p>Q1) Is that right understood? If choosing b) The game itself can use a proprietary version of that data?</p>
<p>2) The game reads the data as created by the converter, meaning that I have something like a "live-version" of my new odbl derivate. When I now build a house at coordinate x/y I would have changed the database-again, meaning this need to be provided somehow!?</p>
<p>Q2) Creating this live "fantasy-data" still creates a derivate, right? So would a live-export-function be ok, sufficent or even not necessary? (Actually it sounds like a quite cool idea :D)</p>
<p>Q3) If there would be this "live-data" option, would be providing the converter still be necessary?</p>
<p>3) Of course inside the game it is mentioned (in the credits!?) that the data is a derivate of osm.</p>
<p>Conclusion: To be honest, while writing this, I don't see a problem anymore, as there wouldn't be a problem for me to provide something like "live-views" of the data. But it would be nice to hear some comments if I'm right, about the way to handle the data!?</p>

<p>First off osm have not changed its license yet. It is still on CC BY-SA.</p>
<p>Copyright is the rights of a work <strong>after</strong> it is published, you and your users can have data derrived from osm data unpublished without any problems. That means that any data your users generate based on osm data that is not published does not have to be under any license, and you are not forced to publish it.</p>
<p>CC BY-SA and ODbL does not require you to hand out the data on request, or in a human readable format. But the data you do release in whatever for or to whomever you release it to have to be released under an open license. But we do love it if you use an open format when you release it.</p>
