<p>I have contacted one of the authors but did not get any reaction. This is very much a disaster because I have about 1000 pages with links from my website to opentopomap. If this is not fixed soon I will have to change to another alternative if there is one. Sadly I thought Garmin was more trustworthy.</p>

<p>You seem to mix things up. OpenTopoMap is provided by volunteers, Garmin isn't involved at all. Furthermore you can just use the HTTP version as already suggested by user SomeoneElse. Moreover the certificate warning just tells you that the certificate is self-signed. This doesn't have to be bad per se (but it could be avoided by getting a certificate from Let's Encrypt).</p>

<p>Hmm. that doesn't really seem to work. Even when calling the site via http, tiles for the current <em>OpenTopoMap 2.0</em> style will still be loaded via https (it's hardcoded in Javascript).</p>

<p>Re "your website being crippled" - as ever xkcd has a suitable comic for the occasion: <a href="https://xkcd.com/1150/">https://xkcd.com/1150/</a> . Something that you had no terms of service agreement with, and paid no money for, is no longer available.</p>
<p>I'm sure that there are other (free, created by volunteers) alternatives, and also the expertise within the community (all unpaid volunteers) to set up something similar for yourself; but frankly after your comments here a number will be asking why they should bother.</p>

<p>@ SomeoneElse: Do you really believe that running a free service frees you from all responsibilities? I am much aware of problems that might occur and if there is any way I can help I would consider this. But here it seems just a matter of getting the right certificate to solve the problem. I don’t know if one needs to pay for such certificate and, if so, how much it would cost, but if needed, you can always ask your users to contribute. Anyway: opentopomap is a great initiative and I would be very sad for the creators and users to see this project going to end. But if you lack time, budget or facing other problems in what turns out to be a valuable asset for others, why not asking for help? If you’re left alone in this project why not reorganize and look for more people to assist you? Everyone will understand and I am sure helping hands will be found.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/12718/jorisvdb">@JorisVdB</a> For some people making nice things is just a hobby. If they don't want to reorganize their hobby it's up to them. If they haven't got time for sorting out TLS certs, that's up to them too. They have no responsibility for their hobbies, the same way as someone isn't forced to keep running or cycling if that's their hobby either.</p>
