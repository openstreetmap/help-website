<p>In Hong Kong and possibly some parts of Guangdong, two editors – <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/West%20Lake">West Lake</a> and <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/00crashtest">00crashtest</a> – have made mass retaggings of several thousand ways from <code>highway=primary</code> or <code>highway=trunk</code> to <code>highway=motorway</code>. 00crashtest has additionally re-tagged several dozen railway tracks; West Lake has also removed several dozen connecting roads at intersections (which already had restriction relations) and apparently moved thousands of nodes to fit Microsoft's aerial imagery.</p>
<p>Is there an easy/quick way to revert the harmful edits without also reverting the rest of their contributions in the changesets? The JOSM reverter might not work well with it, considering there are about 100 changesets to revert, and several objects have been edited multiple times by both editors.</p>

<p>Hello, I would like to apologize for not consulting the Hong Kong specific highway tagging page before making some adjustments in Hong Kong. While I understand that some of my edits did not follow those guidelines, I made a number of correct and valid edits per the OSM Highway Tagging guidelines. All edits on highway:primary and below I believe to be correct. I am knowledgable on road networks, I just missed the Hong Kong specific page.</p>
<p>Although I am newer to this community, I do care about my edits and actions. If it is a matter of reclassifying a few highways back to their original state, can work toward fixing those. I also noticed a few restriction relations which were modeled incorrectly, which is why I removed them and fixed the geometry.</p>
<p>Please do not revert all my changesets in Hong Kong as I spent quite a bit of time fixing legitimately bad data that existed. I am open to all communication about this issue.</p>

<p>Please email data@osmfoundation.org about this. It is possible to revert all their edits in a certain time frame even if objects have been touched multiple times, but more difficult to pick out certain types of edits ("revert only the moving of nodes but not their creation") etc. but even that can be done.</p>
