<p>Hi</p>
<p>We have a six-lane major road (3 lanes each way). It has a median in the middle.</p>
<p>At one place, a median break is provided, so that drivers coming from both sides of the road can take U-turn.</p>
<p>However, this gap is kept narrow by design, so that only two-wheelers and LMVs (=Light Motor Vehicles, such as cars) can use it.</p>
<p>Further, for a 100m stretch that leads to this break in the median, the authorities have placed barriers to separate the lane closest to the median. Drivers who want to take a U-turn are supposed to take this lane. Lack of a large turning radius further ensures that only smaller vehicles can take this lane (and then the U-turn).</p>
<p>So larger vehicles like buses and lorries cannot negotiate through the lane+gap.</p>
<p>I would like to map this situation in OSM. Question is, how?</p>
<p>I use iD. I have added many POIs and single-lane roads; and also set some traffic restrictions like "no right" at a signal (India drives on left).</p>
<p>But I don't know how to use iD to set attributes (e.g. access type, or dedicated lanes).</p>
<p>The OSM help is theoretical, BUT does not explain how to use iD or Potlatch2 to set those values. Can someone provide a step-by-step tutorial example?</p>
<p>Secondly, the Indian Motor Vehicle Act uses some definitions like LMV, MMV HMV (light/medium/heavy Motorized Vehicle); which are not found in tags. IINW all Commonwealth countries follow similar nomenclature. So this issue applies to multiple countries. So even in theory, how to set those tags??</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Regards, Narayan</p>

<p>In OpenStreetMap terms your categories correspond to various <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:access">access</a> tags as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>2-wheeled vehicles to <strong>motorcycle</strong></li>
<li>LMV to <strong>motorcar</strong></li>
<li>MMV to <strong>goods</strong></li>
<li>HMV to <strong>hgv</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Narrow gaps can be mapped with maxwidth (although this is not something I suspect is widely used in routers). Any additional complexity can probably be handled with similar tags, such as maxweight, but again don't count on these being used by routers.</p>
<p>To add these tags in iD you probably need to go into the All Tags panel where you can add any tags just by clicking on the <strong>+</strong> (plus) icon and then typing them in.</p>
<p>There are various visualisations of turn restrictions, but not of the other types of access restriction. This is a shame as it would help to check that you have placed the restrictions accurately.</p>
