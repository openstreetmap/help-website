<p>I'm learning the ropes to contribute to OSM and currently mapping the street where I live. I think I've made a mistake by plotting 3 terraced houses as 3 tightly placed rectangle areas but without touching the nodes, so projecting as individual houses.</p>
<p>I've subsequently learnt the correct way of mapping terraced houses but the question is, how do I fix what I've already mapped? Should I delete 3 houses and restart using the correct method or is there a way to join 3 individual ones to turn into terraced houses? Any instructions using ID editor will be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi, I don't use the iD editor but have had a look at your buildings in iD. Select/highlight one building, drag a corner node onto the corner node of the adjacent building, release it, it should stick/join the two corner nodes together, (test by again dragging the joined node, it should drag the corners of both buildings. Repeat for all corners to be joined, square up all building to neaten them. Regards Bernard</p>

<p>Perfect! You explanation and steps were pretty clear and worked. I've just updated one set of houses as terraced type and will work to correct others as well.</p>
<p>After joining the nodes of adjacent buildings, I set the building type tag as Terraced House. Please suggest if anything else that I should know when mapping terraced or semi-detached houses.</p>
