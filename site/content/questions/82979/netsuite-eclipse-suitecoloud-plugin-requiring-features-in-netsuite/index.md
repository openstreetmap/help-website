<p>We recently refreshed our NetSuite sandbox from production. Prior to doing so, I created an Eclipse SDF project containing all the development stuff I was working on, so that I could re-import it after the refresh.</p>
<p>After the refresh of the sandbox, I tried to deploy the SDF project and Eclipse threw the errors:</p>
<p>An error occurred during account settings validation. Details: To install this SuiteCloud project, the ADVANCEDEXPENSEMANAGEMENT(Advanced Expense Management) feature must be enabled in the account. Details: To install this SuiteCloud project, the SUBSCRIPTIONBILLING(Subscription Billing) feature must be enabled in the account. Details: To install this SuiteCloud project, the WMSSYSTEM(Warehouse Management) feature must be enabled in the account. Details: To install this SuiteCloud project, the BILLINGACCOUNTS(Billing Accounts) feature must be enabled in the account.</p>
<p>2021-08-18 12:05:29 (PST) Installation FAILED (0 minutes 21 seconds)</p>
<p>Firstly, I can't find those features anywhere in NetSuite to enable them. SuiteAnswers is no help, nor can I find anything else online.</p>
<p>Secondly, there's nothing in my development stuff that has anything to do with expenses, billing or the warehouse. Why would Eclipse need them?</p>
<p>Thirdly, my development stuff was running just fine in the sandbox prior to our refresh - and what was in the sandbox was (again) a copy of our production environment, which didn't have those features enabled.</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong? Why is it requiring these features? Where are they in NetSuite so I can enable them?</p>
