If that's a TCP connection for you, then yes, loading a web site will create several tcp connections, at least in most of the cases. Try it with www.wireshark.org. See what get's loaded ;-)</p><blockquote><p>My whole intention here is to identify web services by these characteristics, <strong>(flow duration, multiple flows)</strong></p></blockquote><p>Based on my experience: That's by far not sufficient to identify anything ;-)</p><blockquote><p>Is there any provision in Wireshark to see the occurence of multiple flows?</p></blockquote><p>Again, how do you define a 'flow'? If it's just TCP connections, then take a look at the 'Conversations' I mentioned in the answer.</p></div><div id="comment-26481-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(28 Oct '13, 09:26)</span> Kurt Knochner ♦</div></div><span id="27934"></span><div id="comment-27934" class="comment"><div id="post-27934-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Yes I get that point you have mentioned regarding the flow duration. My intention here is to give a higher priority to web page as compared to, say, video, VoIP etc. So I want to examine the following things: I want to implement the web traffic identification methods I proposed (data flow duration and multiple flows) and test this, via Wireshark, on actual traffic, due to which web traffic would get a higher priority as compared to other traffic(video VoIP). And, the HTTP GET message sent on port 80 is able to identify the web traffic, so I want to compare the above 2 methods (flow duration and multiple flows) to see whether these 2 methods(flow duration and multiple flows) can be used to identify the web traffic, and if yes, will it give i higher priority to the web traffic over other services. So can you help me on this?</p></div><div id="comment-27934-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(08 Dec '13, 18:57)</span> ron1</div></div><span id="27936"></span><div id="comment-27936" class="comment"><div id="post-27936-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I made your answer a comment ron1 (as it was a comment to Kurt's answer). A few questions/comments in response to it though:</p><ul><li><p>Why would you ever want to prioritize HTTP over VoIP or video? In almost all situations, you should do the opposite because those are real-time applications that need low-latency more than HTTP traffic does.</p></li><li><p>Unless your network is actually congested, configuring QoS to prioritize HTTP traffic will have no affect. You need to have contested bandwidth between these applications for that to make a difference.</p></li><li><p>The time it takes to load a webpage does not always have the network as the bottleneck. If the page you're calling requires the web server to consult an application and/or database to get the information to present to the user, for example, tweaking network priorities will not improve the performance.</p></li></ul></div><div id="comment-27936-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(08 Dec '13, 19:43)</span> Quadratic</div></div><span id="27944"></span><div id="comment-27944" class="comment"><div id="post-27944-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>My intention here is to give a <strong>higher priority to web page</strong> as compared to, say, video, VoIP etc.</p></blockquote><p>O.K. in that case I'll repeat my statement: Based on my experience, <strong>flow duration</strong> and <strong>flow count</strong> is by far not sufficient to identify anything ;-)</p><p>Of course, in general, HTTP requests will be much shorter than a video stream. However: There are also long lived HTTP connections, if you download a large piece of content, which can also be a video! Then, how do you differentiate a long video stream from a long VoIP call, only by looking at the flow count (1 for both) and the flow duration (maybe the same)?</p><p>Furthermore, if you want to use flow <strong>duration</strong> for QoS (Quality of service), that won't work at all.</p><p>Reason: To know the duration of a connection, you'll have to wait until it ends (or at least long enough the classify it as a 'long lasting' connection). However, then it might be to late to apply any traffic shaping (for sure if the connection has ended). So, the <strong>flow duration</strong> is really useless for QoS, except for a few uses cases, where you want to apply some kind of quota.</p><p>To be able to implement an <strong>efficient</strong> QoS policy, you need to identify the protocol as fast as possible at the beginning of the connection. That is usually done by analyzing</p><ul><li>protocols</li><li>ports</li><li>signature bytes (like HTTP GET, SMTP commmands, Mime-Types, etc.)</li></ul><p>I don't want to discourage you, but based on the information you provided so far, I suggest to look for other ways to classify content (HTTP, video, voip), than trying to use flow duration and flow count, as that's not going to work very well. I would even say: It's not going to work at all.</p><p>You wrote</p><blockquote><p>I had read in an IEEE paper that for the web page the flow duration is shorter as compared to the flow duration for a video.</p></blockquote><p>I asked for the link to that paper. Could you please post it here? I'm interested in what they were looking at and what the results were.</p><p>Cheers<br />
