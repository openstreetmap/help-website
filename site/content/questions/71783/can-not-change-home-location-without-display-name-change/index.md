When entering location (either direct GPS coordinates or using map pin), all that would return is "display name already in use". I am not adding, but updating. Finally the only way to get it to work is to change my display name? Seem obvious, but sounds like a bug, it can not tell update from an add.</p>

<p>I moved my home point sucessfully just to test the system, but I find i can't upvote or accept an answer ( to my recent question) also I can't delete or edit my comments allways. I am moving between Chrome and Firefox. a while ago it allways worked fine for me. Maybe it just doesn't work for kzuk on his setup.</p>

<p>In order to "change home location without display name change" I did this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selected "my settings" from the menu at the top right</li>
<li>tick the "Update home location when I click on the map?" box</li>
<li>click on the map</li>
<li>Save changes</li>
</ol>
<p>I can now see my new home location. I'm using Firefox on Linux (KDE). Note that I don't want to change my display name, so I'm not typing anything in that box at all. What are you doing that is different?</p>

<p>Perhaps you need to read what I said again - particulary the bit where I say "I'm not typing anything into the display name field".</p>
<p>Perhaps you are, or perhaps your browser is defaulting a value in there? Also, you haven't said which browsers you are seeing this with - you've said "all", but it is unlikely that you have tried every browser ever written.</p>
<p>Finally, please do come down off your high horse and join the rest of us on the ground trying to find a solution. i'm trying to help you here and shouting "I can read" (when you perhaps haven't understood the nuances of what might be happening) isn't helpful.</p>

<p>sk53, the reason I wrote what I did was because answers to questions would be worthwhile effort IF people would read what people wrote and if they DO NOT have a viable solution, simply say nothing. Repeat of written process, is no value. If related problems, then answer the question in that related topic, not another topic. I have turned off notifications on this question as I have solved a workaround on my own.</p>

<p>For anyone else who may come across this question, troubleshooting an issue often requires asking additional questions in order to help identify the cause of the issue and therefore a solution. It's relatively rare to be able to jump straight from a report of an issue to a solution. Please cooperate with those who are volunteering their time to try to help you. Also, if you're able to solve the problem on your own or a provided solution works for you, please come back and say so, because that turns the question and answer into a valuable resource for anyone else who may encounter the same issue in the future.</p>
