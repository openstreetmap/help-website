You also have the option of specifying on a per-interface basis (after the -i statement) but since I'm only capturing off of one interface, I set the buffer globally. I don't know if that's the most sensible size, but it seems to work and has worked reliably for over 24 hours. The documentation also states that hardware may silently limit the buffer size, so I don't know if I'm only using a portion of that or not.</p><p>The -n switch is not supported in dumpcap since it's not sensible for the capture process to try to do DNS lookups...</p><p>I haven't had trouble with the 2 MiB buffer ever before and the write failures occurred both when at heavy load -- middle of the day capture -- but also late at night when the network was relatively quiescent. Still, it seemed to be worse with load. I don't know the root cause of the instability (patching/rebooting may have been a red herring) but in any case if your captures aren't as stable as you'd like, try increasing the buffer.</p><p>At this point, I think I'm fixed so I'm marking this as the answer. Thanks for the help!</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>09 Feb '16, 06:01</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2286d3512378e2315df94294d815af95?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="OvrSteer&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>OvrSteer</span><br />

Sometimes it works for hours, sometimes minutes.</p><p>I switched to using dumpcap directly just to see if that made any difference, but it did not. (The only difference is omitting the -n switch on the command line.)

I have a script that gathers previously recorded capture files and then has tcpdump slice them for specific time ranges and IP addresses. When this happens, it <em>may</em> cause tshark/dumpcap to fail. Still investigating, but it seems like this issue may be happening at least party because of some underlying instability. I'm just not sure what that might have been as patches didn't touch much (this is a minimal system) and the kernel has already been backed out. If I find the root cause, I'll update this.</p></div><div id="comment-49817-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(04 Feb '16, 06:16)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">OvrSteer</span></div></div><span id="49819"></span><div id="comment-49819" class="comment"><div id="post-49819-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Is the script accessing the file that is currently being written to by dumpcap, or is it skipping it and only processes "closed" files?</p><p>Maybe there's an file access sharing problem - I have a tool that accesses a running dumpcap file ring, and before reading any of them (which would be possible even for the active file) I check if I can access them exclusively.
