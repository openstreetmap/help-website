Why the client has increased the window size during initial handshake is an example of a question which Wireshark cannot answer. Packet capture and analysis can always tell you <em>what</em> has happened but only sometimes <em>why</em> it has happened.</p><p>E.g. we may assume that the TCP stack of the client uses some hardcoded window size value when sending the initial SYN packet and only uses the real value when it sends the first "useful" packet, but only analysis of the source code of the client's TCP stack and application can give the real answer.</p><p>What <em>is</em> negotiated is the support of window size scale factor. Until the client gets a confirmation from the server that the server supports window size scale factor as well (through presence of the ws option in the server's SYN, ACK packet), it does not know whether it may make use of it. So the window size value in the client's SYN packet is actually just a "safe side" one and the real value is only indicated when it becomes clear which way to specify it (with or without use of the ws factor).</p><p>Just to be clear: <em>support</em> of ws is negotiated, <em>value</em> of ws is not. Each side announces (and subsequently uses) its own ws value.</p><p>But this is still not an answer <em>why</em> the size indicated in the SYN packet was 8192 bytes and not, say, 65500 bytes, which would be closer to the "real" value announced later.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>14 Mar '16, 14:19</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/00fc6e2633725bd871ff636f0175eabc?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="sindy&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>sindy</span><br />

So there may simply be no reason at all behind use of that particular value of 8192. If there is, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6528">RFC6528</a> should explain it.</p></div><div id="comment-50917-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(15 Mar '16, 04:11)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div><span id="50920"></span><div id="comment-50920" class="comment"><div id="post-50920-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p><span></span><span>@Ibrahim</span>-el-khalil, more "!" do not cause more understanding on the receiving side.</p><p>What are you going to achieve, or what problem are you tracking?</p><p>The fact that the size of the receiving window grows and shrinks throughout the lifetime of the session is normal. MSS is a fixed value throughout the whole session as it is a property of the network path; window size is a dynamic value as it depends on the application behaviour: if the data have arrived fine to the receiving buffer of the tcp stack but the application doesn't fetch them from the buffer, the window size may decrease down to 0; as soon as the application fetches the data, the window will grow again.

But with different servers, other factor than the delay between the SYN and SYN,ACK may exist: you may also observe whether the window size announced by the server affects the window size announced by the client in its first ACK packet (ignore the window size in SYN, it will be the same in all cases).</p></div><div id="comment-50977-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 Mar '16, 13:38)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-50904" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 19 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 14 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-50904-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

And my reading of what RFC7323 says is the same: it states that the shift (scaling) must be used in all "segments" except &lt;syn&gt; ones (plural), however a few lines above it clearly distinguishes between &lt;syn&gt; and &lt;syn,ack&gt; segment, which to me implies that in &lt;syn,ack&gt;, the scaling must be used too.</p><p>So to me, the correct way would be that Wireshark would show the resulting value as a product starting already from the 2nd packet of the session, not the 3rd one.

It is from my point of view a theoretical thing. There is window size and she would be processed. For the SYN,ACK interpreation the RFC 1323 Page 8 states it clearly:<br />
<code>The Window field in a SYN (i.e., a &lt;syn&gt; or &lt;syn,ack&gt;) segment          itself is never scaled.</code></p></div><div id="comment-50991-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 Mar '16, 15:07)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Christian_R</span></div></div><span id="50992"></span><div id="comment-50992" class="comment"><div id="post-50992-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>And that's the point, I read the RFC1323 (or RFC7323 which uses the same wording in this part) differently. For me a "SYN,ACK <em>segment</em>" is not the same as a "SYN <em>segment</em>", as throughout the document the authors use these names in the meaning of "the 2nd handshake packet" and "the 1st handshake packet", respectively. Maybe we should ask the RFC authors what they had in mind?</p></div><div id="comment-50992-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 Mar '16, 15:20)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div><span id="50994"></span><div id="comment-50994" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-50994-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>the Slow start algorithm still is an hypothesis</p></div><div id="comment-50994-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 Mar '16, 15:27)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">IBrahim El-K...</span></div></div><span id="51002"></span><div id="comment-51002" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-51002-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p><span>@Christian_R</span>, I've re-read the RFC7323 - yes, they use the exact phrase which you've quoted but I've somehow missed it before.
