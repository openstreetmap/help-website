<p>It looks like you edited ways added by contributors that didn't accept the new licence and terms, and the redaction bot removed them. <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/25466301/history">This</a> appears to be an example. As Richard says, if you've got your original notes you can add them back (and the area is at least partially covered by GPS traces to help with alignment).</p>

<p>Looks like that may have happened, I had accepted but a few people I just checked that was editing in this area had not, all my traces where uploaded so they should still be there. Time to start editing.</p>

<p>Yes, it's almost certainly related to the redaction for the licence change.</p>
<p>Unfortunately numerous contributors in Australia didn't accept the new licence/terms - much more than any other country. Any data which they touched has had to be reverted to its state before they edited it. In some cases, unfortunately, this can lead to the removal of data "created" by other people.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of work since the redaction to bring the map of Australia back to an acceptable state. Hopefully you still have your GPS tracks or notes so that you can repair the damage.</p>
