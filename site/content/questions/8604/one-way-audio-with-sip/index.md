Called the provider (ViaTalk) and was told they have to change the proxy setting on their end which fixed fast busy, but introduced ONE WAY audio on all incoming calls, however outgoing calls don’t seem to have this problem. ViaTalk’s solution to one way audio was changing SCTP port from 5061 to 5081 in the phone adapter, but as it made NO difference they blamed it on my router (which was working fine for the past 3 years) and hung up.<br />
</p><p>I was able capture phone adapter traffic using my laptop (nic in promiscuous mode), but to see the whole picture I think I need to do another capture between the cable modem and the router, just not sure what to capture.</p><p>The capture I got from behind the router looks like this. (66.147.235.3) sip: [email protected] communicates with my PAP2T (192.168.20.240) via 5061 and 5060 once connection is established, 192.168.20.240 communicates with 209.244.30.233 IP (G.711). Src Port: 16412 (16412), Dst Port: 60858 (60858) As I put my laptop with wireshark between the router and a cable modem, I am assuming 192.168.20.240 will not show up in the capture and the only IPs I can configure a filter for are 209.244.30.233 &amp; 66.147.235.3?</p><p>Also I am guessing I will see something in the conversation with 209.244.30.233 in front on the router that I don’t see behind?</p><p>Thank you for your help</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">one sip way audio</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>25 Jan '12, 08:07</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bcfdf26904f3a8a9fb69c7ca0dc5e7b1?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="net_tech&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>net_tech<br />

When you say 1-way - you are able to hear them, or they are able to hear you? Judging by the sip.txt file you linked to it appears that the call controller is detecting an unhealthy connection and closing it - but I can't tell. Have you tried setting the PAP as your DMZ host?</p></div><div id="comment-8746-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(01 Feb '12, 07:53)</span> GeonJay</div></div><span id="8756"></span><div id="comment-8756" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-8756-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Jaap,</p><p>UDP stream was captured after the router and the translation rules have not changed I have 2 ranges set up (5060-5080) &amp; (10000-20000).
