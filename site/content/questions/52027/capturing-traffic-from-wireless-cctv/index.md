So if it is the case, first start the capture in monitoring mode on your MAC, then restart the camera, and then switch off and on WiFi on the iPhone. After that, you have to tell Wireshark the passphrase to your WLAN.

The display filter which shall quickly show you whether you have really captured them is <code>eapol</code>. In the Info column of packet list, you must see "Key (Message 1 of 4)" through to "Key (Message 4 of 4)". If you've missed any of the EAPOL frames while capturing for a given device, the decryption for that device won't work.</p><p>The EAPOL negotiation takes place each time the STA associates to the WLAN, and the negotiated keys differ each time and for each device even though the passphrase is the same for all. Switching the device off and on is one possibility how to enforce the EAPOL negotiation, but you may use a smaller hammer on some devices - switch off an on only the WLAN connection, or switch the device to sleep mode and wake it up again. But I suspect that the only method for the camera will be a power cycle.</p><p>If you can see that you have captured all the EAPOL packets but the decryption doesn't work anyway, I'd suggest you to temporarily change the passphrase to some other one which you're really unlikely to use normally, take the capture including the association phase of the devices, and publish that capture, login-free, somewhere like at Cloudshark (preferred by the community around this site), Google drive, Dropbox, ... and provide a link to it here so that we could have a look what may be wrong without disclosing the passphrase you use normally.</p></div><div id="comment-52087-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(29 Apr '16, 10:46)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="52090"></span><div id="comment-52090" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-52090-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>hello Sindy,</p><p>I think my decryption key doesn't work.

</p><p>With a filter:</p><pre><code>eapol</code></pre><p>I see two sets of full 4-way handshake:</p><p><img src="https://osqa-ask.wireshark.org/upfiles/eapol1_lbzL55G.png" alt="alt text" /></p><p>for devices</p><pre><code>(wlan.bssid == 00:1d:aa:ea:ca:42) or (wlan.addr == 6c:72:e7:05:60:60)</code></pre><p>So the only frames that could be decrypted are after this 4-way handshake, and before the next set (i.e. as long as this PTK is in use, so up to a rekey, death, disassociate, etc). Group key traffic is handled a little different, but a detail not likely critical here.</p><p>This filter gives me the frames for wlan client, and show only good ones:</p><pre><code>(wlan.addr == 6c:72:e7:05:60:60) and wlan.fcs_good == 1</code></pre><p>So I don't see any Data frames between frame 3312 (Key 4 message) and a disassociate in frame 3594.<br />
</p><p>Your issue is not decryption, it is capturing packets. I see both client and AP support 802.11n/ac (HT/VHT). How are you capturing in the local RF environment? I see the Checksum is passed up but no MCS index value, what capture device are you using? Is it 802.11abg capable only?</p><p>I can infer traffic is passing between devices due to the block ACKs, CTS/RTS, etc. These are sent usually transmitted at lower rates so probability is that we are more likely to see these than data frames which would be sent at a higher rate/modulation.</p><p>Note this finding might be consistent with the claim that a 2.4GHz/unencrypted environment was setup and all worked well. Apple devices will not use 802.11n rates (and no device can do 802.11ac) on 2.4GHz, so perhaps the recognition of unencrypted traffic was due to the capture mechanism handling 802.11b/g rate frames properly. I note this capture is on channel 36 (5GHz). So we have two changes compounding the difficulties: 5GHz and capture of likely high speed unicast frames and encryption. Perhaps try encrypted 2.4GHz configuration to see if you can get decryption to work, then address the other modulation issue with 5GHz.</p><p>I also note that this is not generally true:</p><blockquote><p>No, if the WLAN driver is in monitoring mode, the destination MAC address filter, which you normally deactivate by setting promiscuous mode, is not active.</p></blockquote><p>I have a handful of adapters with various chipsets that support monitor mode but not promiscuous mode. I do agree that checking the box in Wireshark for promisc mode has no effect, but general searches on Google for this topic make similar claims: monitor mode is all that is needed. Perhaps there is a better term or concept so this might be technically a correct statement, as written, but practically it is a myth. Not all chipsets pass up unicast frames from other hosts even of they do monitor mode. Perhaps this behavior is a bug and monitor mode is supposed to mean no filter, but it happens.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>30 Apr '16, 05:11</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a47ef51dd9c9996d194a4983295f5a4?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Bob%20Jones&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Bob Jones<br />

I know Apple devices (nor Cisco APs) won't do 40MHz on 2.4GHz so I actually mis-typed - they will do some n rates, just not the wide channels - sorry for my confusion. I was looking at his beacons and they are set for 40MHz for 802.11n,</p><p>.... .... .... ..1. = HT Support channel width: Transmitter supports 20MHz and 40MHz operation</p><p>and looks like 80MHz on ac as well:</p><p>.... .... .... .... .... .... ..1. .... = Short GI for 80MHz: Supported</p><p>Since the network appears to support high speed rates with n/ac, wide channels, etc., his unicast frames will be high speed so they will be difficult to capture.<br />

This assumes you don't want the MAC to be connected to anything. If you do, then obviously you don't want to do this, and you won't be able to capture a different channel at the same time.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>i need to turn 5Ghz</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>You should be able to sniff 5GHz, it will just take more work to get the capture mechanism correct. Try the tool referenced in the link above and set your Mac as a dedicated sniffer to the 5GHz channel and proper width - I'm guessing 80MHz from the probes/beacons in an earlier trace - and see if you can catch the 5GHz traffic.</p></div><div id="comment-52124-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(01 May '16, 11:36)</span> Bob Jones</div></div><span id="52125"></span><div id="comment-52125" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-52125-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Well, from what Carlo wrote over time I've concluded that while the AP supports 2.4 and 5 GHz simultaneously, the camera doesn't. And as the Mscbook Pro in monitoring mode remained tuned to the 5 GHz channel to which it was previously associated, it could only monitor at 5 GHz, and thus could only see part of the iPhone's 5 GHz traffic but none of the camera's 2.4 GHz one.</p><p>So while the AP can bridge the 802.11 frames between the camera and the iPhone, so the frames which the camera is sending to the iPhone could be spotted on the "5 GHz" portion of their way which spans from the AP to the iPhone (provided that the AP would be sending them using a modulation scheme the Macbook Pro would understand), to fulfil the task of finding out all IPs to which the camera is talking to, it is necessary to set the Macbook Pro to monitor at the proper channel at 2.4 GHz.</p><p>And, having myself no clue how to instruct the wireless driver what channel to tune to in monitoring mode (I don't own any Mac), I can imagine that Carlo also depends on what channel the adaptor was associated before the monitoring mode has been activated, and so the easiest way to make the Macbook Pro monitor at the right channel in 2.4 GHz band may be to simply disable the 5 GHz band on the AP.</p></div><div id="comment-52125-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(01 May '16, 12:00)</span> sindy</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-52107" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 7 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 2 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-52107-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
