If the ACK was captured on one machine and the FIN+ACK was captured on another machine, perhaps the two machines clocks are out of sync, in which case you can't meaningfully compare time stamps on packets from two different machines, and therefore it means that you can't say that anything went backwards in time.</p></div><div id="comment-32862-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(17 May '14, 14:13)</span> Guy Harris ♦♦</div></div><span id="32863"></span><div id="comment-32863" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-32863-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Note also that, even if the ACK and the FIN+ACK were captured on the <em>same</em> machine, if that machine's clock were reset between the arrival or transmission time of the ACK and the FIN+ACK, it will make it look as if the FIN+ACK were sent before the ACK when, in fact, it was sent after the ACK.</p></div><div id="comment-32863-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(17 May '14, 14:18)</span> Guy Harris ♦♦</div></div><span id="32878"></span><div id="comment-32878" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-32878-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Hi Guy,</p><p>How could I see if a clock is reset ? thanks</p></div><div id="comment-32878-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(19 May '14, 00:02)</span> lmdroke</div></div><span id="32879"></span><div id="comment-32879" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-32879-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>About all you can to in order to determine whether the clock was reset in the past is to check whatever system logs the machine has, <em>if</em> it logs time changes, to see whether the clock was set backwards.</p></div><div id="comment-32879-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(19 May '14, 00:07)</span> Guy Harris ♦♦</div></div><span id="32969"></span><div id="comment-32969" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-32969-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Another think to look for would be if any NTP packets existed during that time in the trace.
