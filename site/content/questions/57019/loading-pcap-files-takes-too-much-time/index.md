What version of Wireshark do you use, on what operating system? And can you publish the problematic file on some plain file publishing service and edit your question with a login-free link to it?</p></div><div id="comment-57021-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(06 Nov '16, 01:22)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div><span id="57050"></span><div id="comment-57050" class="comment"><div id="post-57050-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Thank you for your response!</p><p>I am using latest wireshark version 2.2.1.</p><p>I tried the following, Uninstalled 2.2.1 and installed old version 1.12.4.
