<p>Individual graves have received little mapping attention on OSM so far, except for graves of famous people, such as that of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/269780416">Jim Morrison</a> which is tagged <code>historic=grave</code>. There is however a key cemetery which has been used to provide a context for micromapping of cemeteries, and <code>cemetery=grave</code> has 600 odd uses. Although your particular grave is not in a grave yard, I would use this tag.</p>
<p>Only use <code>historic=grave</code> if there is particular historic interest; and historic=memorial should be reserved for true memorials (although of course they may incorporate a grave or graves, such as ossuaries associated with battlefields: such as those on the Alpine front in Italy and at <a href="http://osm.org/go/0Bv32inE9--">Donaumont</a>). (If all graves used <code>historic=memorial</code> then I could not have used Nominatim to find my examples, whereas now one can ask for 'memorial near Verdun').</p>
<p>At least one OSM contributor has special knowledge in this area having done civil service in lieu of military service working in graveyards.</p>
<p>There is considerable scope within OSM for mapping cemeteries (particularly war cemeteries) as it is often difficult to find a specific grave when visiting a cemetery after a number of years. It is for this reason I have mapped <a href="http://osm.org/go/eucbCfqvQ--">this cemetery</a> in some detail as I visit it perhaps every 10 years. Each time I have difficulty finding my uncle's grave and I have never seen that of my great-grandmother.</p>
