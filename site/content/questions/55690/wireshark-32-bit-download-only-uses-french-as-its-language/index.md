With the old settings, were Windows applications other than Wireshark showing their menus in English? If so, perhaps you had a version of Windows that didn't include support for French, so it fell back on the English-language menus.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilingual_User_Interface">It appears that, in Windows 7, only the Ultimate and Enterprise editions can support multiple languages, and even those editions won't necessarily have language packets installed for all possible languages</a>. Perhaps you have a version of Windows 7 other than the Ultimate or Enterprise version, and it's an English-language version, or perhaps it's an Ultimate or Enterprise version but doesn't have a French language pack installed; I think either of those means that, even with the locale set to "French-speaking Belgium", the text displayed by Microsoft's applications and system code will be in English.</p><p><em>However</em>, Wireshark uses the Qt toolkit, which provides its <em>own</em> localization mechanism, rather than using Windows's mechanism, so it can display non-English-language menus on Windows <em>even if you have an English-language-only installation of Windows</em>. That might be the reason why, with "French-speaking Belgium" (fr-BE) as the locale, Wireshark displayed French-language menus but nothing else on your system did.</p></div><div id="comment-55772-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(23 Sep '16, 02:04)</span> Guy Harris ♦♦</div></div><span id="55774"></span><div id="comment-55774" class="comment"><div id="post-55774-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Hi Guy, Yes this is Win7 Enterprise.
