<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a process in place to download general information about all countries and their major cities. The process runs mostly once a month, however lately it's not managing to execute, always giving too many requests error or timeouts. I have a retry mechanism that allows for intervals when such errors occur, so as not to spam the server, however lately not even that that help. I was wondering whether someone could let me know whether it is possible that my specific IP could have been blocked by the overpass server and what could I possibly do in such case.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
