<p>So, I'm currently mapping out my hometown, and we have a lot of these Soviet style apartment buildings where everyone lives in. Some of them are connected together with different "connector" bits. In some cases, it's just a brick arch, in some cases it's like a corridor that goes between them. And there's always a footpath going through on the outside. But in both of those cases, they are each a separate freestanding building, rather then a single building with building passage through it. Sometimes both buildings would have a single address, some times they would have a different streetnumber assigned to each.</p>
<p>How would you map? Draw a single building shape? Put a tunnel=building_passage under ?</p>
<p>Draw two buildings and connect them with the corner nodes? But then, it's not just a connecting point, it's an area.</p>
<p>Draw two buildings and draw the middle bit out separately, and put layer=1 on the middle bit? But what would the middle bit tags be?</p>
<p>This is the place, and one of them: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/111713800">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/111713800</a> <img src="/upfiles/2020-05-06_00-36-12_cUXuLjN.jpg" alt="alt text" /> <img src="/upfiles/2020-05-06_00-34-56_iCdAwrQ.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>For the second one, I definitely use tunnel=building passage. For the first one, I would ignore the small piece at the top and just map it as a path (or footway) between 2 non-connected buildings, as it does not feel that the path is covered.</p>
<p>I guess that when you are mapping 3D buildings (or want to be more precise), you might want to map that small piece as well.</p>

<p>Would you map 2 buildings for the second one or one? I didn't think of it at first but I'm thinking now that I'm gonna do two buildings with connected nodes and add the overhang part to one of them.</p>

<p>I tend to split such buildings only when they do have different house numbers. However, that might depend on the local situation.</p>

<p>I'd definitely map them as separate buildings with the connector possibly as a third or as you suggest as part of one of them (either way you are going to need to tag this part separately). For the second I agree, a single building with tunnel=building_passage. I presume the connector contains some kind of infrastructural service such as heating or electricity</p>
