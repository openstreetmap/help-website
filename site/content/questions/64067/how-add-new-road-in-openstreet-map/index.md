<p>Hi Fosiul, first head over to the wiki and read through the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide">beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>There any several different editors for OSM, but it's easiest to start with the built-in editor "iD". This is described in the beginners guide. The first time you use it, it will launch into a tutorial mode and you'll be able to learn how to make and tag a road.</p>
<p>There might be satellite imagery already available in iD that will show your road. If not, uploading a GPS trace is a good way to find where to put the road. (Note that just uploading the GPS trace does not cause the road to appear on the map, but it will show you where to put it.)</p>
<p>I haven't used it myself, but people speak highly of the android app <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Vespucci">Vespucci</a>. It will be able to record GPS traces and upload them to the OpenStreetMap server. It can also be used as an OSM editor right from the phone, but better to start off with iD.</p>
<p>If you do map the roads using GPS, you'll probably want to take the road several times, in both directions, at different times, in different weather etc to get a lot of traces, and together they'll give you a good picture of where the road should be drawn.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>No, it won't automatically put the road on the map. But ID or any other OSM editor can display GPS traces. You can then use these as a guide to draw the road in the editor, taking care to connect it correctly to existing roads if there are any already mapped in the area.</p>
<p>Note that any Android app with the capability of recording a GPS trace can be used. Some of these apps also allow editing of OSM as in the example of Vespucci given above, but that is by no means necessary - if you upload a GPX file it doesn't matter which app it came from. So you might want to try a few apps to see which suits you best.</p>
<p>Also consider taking photos to record details on signposts for example (easier when walking than driving).</p>
