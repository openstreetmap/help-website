An ARP request must be broadcast to serve its purpose, and 9 ARP requests per second from 8 different sources, as seen on your picture, are nothing unusual or dangerous.</p><p>In general, if you find a source MAC address in your captures which spams the network with useless arp requests (say, more than 1 request per second per destination IP address, and more than 500 different addresses), the ARP tables of manageable switches should guide you to the port to which the source equipment is connected. If your switches are not managed, hopefully the network is small enough to allow to find the culprit by checking the MAC address of each connected piece of equipment manually. If the network is large and the switches are not manageable, you have no choice but to use an invasive method - split the network into two halves while monitoring on one port, and see whether the source is in the same half as the port on which you monitor. Iterative splitting of the half identified as containing the source into halves should quickly lead you to a single switch to which the source is connected.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>28 Sep '16, 07:31</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/00fc6e2633725bd871ff636f0175eabc?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="sindy&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>sindy</span><br />

If some kind of device teaming is used, the MAC address of the team is usually different from the MAC addresses of the team members as its higher-order bits, which normally identify a manufacturer, are assigned to the teaming protocol. The same applies to multicast addresses.</p><p>So if you are sure that there are more HP MAC addresses in your capture than HP-manufactured devices in your network, it makes sense to suspect some unusual activity (which may then be just pretending that it comes from an HP-manufactured device), and you have to track <strong>each</strong> of those MAC addresses to the source, using the methods suggested in my answer.</p><p>The ARP table of a switch may show that several MAC addresses are associated to a single port. This is normal if the equipment connected to that port is another switch or hub; if it is an end equipment, it deserves investigation.</p></div><div id="comment-55961-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(28 Sep '16, 09:27)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div><span id="55964"></span><div id="comment-55964" class="comment"><div id="post-55964-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>As far as I can see at the screenshot the hp device does not change the mac every time.
