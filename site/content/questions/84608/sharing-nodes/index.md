<p>OK, I think a simple question, but maybe someone can help as I cannot solve the problem by myself. I installed OsmAnd on my new phone and transferred my old nodes, (favorites), using the share function from my old phone. Everything worked and I am very happy. I have since added some new nodes and wanted share the data, (ie: all nodes from the old phone and the new phone together), with a friend. Unfortunately, when I use the share favorites function, only the nodes I have entered since having the new phone are transferred. However all nodes (old and new) and shown as favorites on the map and I can not see how these are differentiated from one another. Now I am of course worried when I upgrade my phone in around 20 months that I will have to re-enter all of my data by hand. Any ideas or suggestions anyone?</p>
