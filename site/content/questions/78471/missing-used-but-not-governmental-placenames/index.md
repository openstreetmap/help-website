<p>Hi, I;ve come across a couple of names that are missing, that are generally used and appear on other maps and in documents, but are not on Open Street Map. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Braich y Pwll, which is a headland on Penllyn, Gwynedd: how would I add this? It is a name for a small promontory, which is not a listed natural feature for "point" for instance. It is mentioned in many places eg <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/wales/aberdaron/attractions/braich-y-pwll/a/poi-sig/1403022/1333814">Lonely Planet</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdaron">Wikipedia</a>.</li>
<li>Coombeswood, near Black Heath, in the Rowley Regis or Dudley metropolitan area.This features on roads in the area, a former steelworks and park walks, as well as other maps and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill,_West_Midlands">Wikipedia</a>, but has no governmental designation. How would I add / classify this?</li>

<p>If a name for something (natural feature or locality) is used as an actual name by actual people, I'd add it to OSM as a name (perhaps "name", perhaps "alt_name", perhaps "local_name" - exactly which tag will depend on the individual example).</p>
<p>I would ignore the fact that a name exists on wikipedia - that just means that it's been copied from somewhere else (and of course wikipedia itself isn't licence-compatible with OSM, although its sources may be). Similarly "sources" such as Lonely Planet - adding that to OSM would just be an example of <a href="https://xkcd.com/978/">citogenesis</a>.</p>
<p>If something has no actual evidence behind it as a name in use now, don't add it to OSM. It might be suitable for <a href="https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/">OpenHistoricalMap</a>, but not OSM.</p>

<p>Thanks. I'm confident both these names are in active use. The links were just examples to show their use by peope other than me.</p>
<p>My problem is that they are not <em>marked</em> so there is nothing to tag.</p>
<p>"Points" seem to require a definition, and "headland" is not a natural feaure in the list. An "area" could be used but there is no specific defined area that I can accurate create a border for these - it would be an arbitrary choice. It is not a "line" object, obviously.</p>
<p>So what kind of object to I create in order to be able to add a name tag?</p>

<p>Braich y Pwll is attested on the OS StreetView Open Data(<a href="https://os.openstreetmap.org/#zoom=16&amp;lat=52.7975&amp;lon=-4.76485)">https://os.openstreetmap.org/#zoom=16&amp;lat=52.7975&amp;lon=-4.76485)</a> which is available in editors as a background layer (but not on OS OpenMap Local which seems to have removed a number of topographic place name elements around here). It's also on old 6 inch maps on the NLS site &amp; therefore features in the dataset captured by crowd sourcing by the National Library of Wales (1900 project), as seen on the RCHMW site <a href="https://historicplacenames.rcahmw.gov.uk/placenames?q=braich+y+pwll.">https://historicplacenames.rcahmw.gov.uk/placenames?q=braich+y+pwll.</a> Modern maps seem to add hyphens.</p>
<p>Coombeswood is mapped, as the current business park seems to cover the same area as the former tube works, and prior to that it looks to have been more a house or estate rather than a suburb or locality. The variant name without the "e" is used on OSM, and there seems an inconsistency between the spelling you provide with the named street on both OS &amp; OSM data. The treatment of the name on historical OS maps is also inconsistent, so I dont think they provide adequate evidence of it as named place=* in OSM terms.</p>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, I'd be reluctant to use the existence of a name on only "OS StreetView Open Data" on its own as evidence to add it to OSM (simply because I know too many examples where no-longer-in-use names or simply descriptive names such as "Poultry Houses" appear there), but if names are in active use then yes, they should be in OSM.</p>

<p>On the second issue ""Points seem to require a definition", yes, any name has to apply to something. There are a number of possibilities - see <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/natural#values">https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/natural#values</a> for what "natural things" people have tagged in the past; "cape" may be one possibility? A fallback placename where there is no population might be "place=locality". I'm guessing that you're using OSM's browser-based editor - try searching for various things in there.</p>

<p>So Google Maps and OS current maps mark Coombeswood as a locality, for instance. People living in the area frequently mention it on web pages.</p>
<p><a href="https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/local/coombeswood-dudley">https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/local/coombeswood-dudley</a> - shows it as a "suburban area" - it's history can be found going back to medieval times; there was more recently a colliery named "Coombeswood" as well as the tube works.</p>
<p><a href="http://hawnebasin.org.uk">http://hawnebasin.org.uk</a> "Coombeswood Canal Trust" for instance shows people using the name for projects in their area (I spotted a few more, but just for example).</p>
<p>Nevertheless I don't quite understand OSM criteria on names.</p>
<p>On Braich y Pwll: hyphens are generally regarded as wrong in modern usage of Welsh, they are more typically how English speaking Victorians wrote Welsh for English readers.</p>
<p>In both cases, what I am completely not understanding is how to classify a "Point" - all the types presented do not seem appropriate in either case.</p>

<p>thanks for both of your help. The issue was that the visual editor pushes you down a list of simple choices for object type, none of which apply. Once you helped me understand that I needed to look through the tag options, it was clearer. I've added both, but the positioning of "Coombeswood" is up for debate. As for "Braich y Pwll", I added this to the headland. The positioning that Ordnance Survey are giving it out to sea cannot be right; the name means "Arm of the pool" and refers to the land area, not the sea beyond it.</p>
