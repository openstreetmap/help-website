<p>I went for a run with a Garmin Forerunner capturing the data for the entire route. I was on a paved trail for a lot of the run. I uploaded the gpx to OSM, and tried to add in a trail that was missing. However, the trail was clearly visible on the Bing satellite map, and it was a bit off from the gpx trail. Which should have precedence for plotting in OSM, the satellite image or the GPS data?</p>

<p>As already answered in <a href="http://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/1200/which-is-more-reliable-gps-traces-or-aerial-imagery">http://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/1200/which-is-more-reliable-gps-traces-or-aerial-imagery</a> this is a hard question. Both aerial imagery and GPS tracks can be great or next to useless.</p>
<p>There are however a few things you can try:</p>
<p>See if your GPS tracks match the tracks by other mappers. If several GPS tracks taken over a few days are consistent with each outher then they are most likely correct and the aerial imagery is warped / shifted.</p>
<p>If there are not other tracks yet you can revisit the street the next day and take a second track. Again if it matches the first track it is most likely more accurate then the aerial imagery.</p>
<p>You can also check if different sources of aerial imagery are in agreement. If they are not at least one of the imagery layers in wrong.</p>
<p>If you don't fell certain enough to make the call after these test you should talk to other mappers in you area to find out what they use as authoritative source.</p>
