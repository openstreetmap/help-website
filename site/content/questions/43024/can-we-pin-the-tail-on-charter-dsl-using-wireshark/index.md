I've worked in the network forensics analysis field for awhile at a major financial company using enterprise tools, but never really dug into all the intricacies of Wireshark - until I changed jobs and my new employer didn't have any tools! Now I'm working on my Wireshark cert, and taking opportunities to look at any/all traffic of interest. As part of this effort, I bought a cheap aggregated 100 Mb TAP for use at home - and didn't install it. I knew that I should be watching my own traffic, but just didn't have time or motivation at the time to get started.</p><p>I recently changed ISP's from AT&amp;T to Charter for various good reasons - when suddenly the need for the TAP presented itself. I hadn't anticipated probs and at first the 100 Mb BW was awesome. However, weirdness began after about 1 month of service.</p><p>I had sent AT&amp;T's 2WIRE router back to them, and moved my personal Buffalo AirStation into position connecting to Charter's Cisco cable modem with the rest of my home network behind it. I didn't optimally configure the internet link on the router, so I wasn't very surprised when I first experienced lost connectivity. I figured that Charter had changed DNS or DHCP servers, the default gateway, or some combination thereof. I'd heard of that before.</p><p>I properly reconfigured my router for DHCP on the internet link, release/renewed and obtained a new Charter IP. Service was restored, problem solved (for the moment). A week later I had another disconnect. When I removed the router and directly connected my old XP workstation used to originally test the link, service was again restored. I reconnected the router and rebooted it, and was online again, for another few days. Then the disconnect started happening every day or two.</p><p>At this point, my wife was flaming me to fix it (must be my fault) - and I wanted some background info before calling Charter. I knew that they were going to blame my router, suggest I should pay for theirs instead, and it was going to be a long and painful support call.<br />
</p><p>So I inserted the TAP between the cable modem and router, installed a USB Ethernet adapter on my XP PC for TAP data collection, turned off the TCP stack, and configured dumpcap to collect a large ring buffer of files with snaplen set to 92. The XP's primary interface was still connected inside the router, and I downloaded a ping plotter and set it to ping Charter's gateway for my current subnet. I was ready for the next outage.</p><p>Within a couple of days, I had another incident. This time I download the router's system log before rebooting it, checked the ping plotter to see exactly when the disconnect happened, and grabbed the corresponding PCAP to keep it from being overwritten. The ISP link continues to drop, so now I have several instances recorded. It usually happens between 4:30-5:30 AM. There is no indication of a problem in the router's logs.</p><p>While the connection is OK and when initiated by the router, a DHCP request resolves successfully. The XP workstation connected directly to the cable modem never has a problem reconnecting via DHCP that needs intervention. The ping plotter provides a log for attempts to ping the gateway, every 10-15 sec. These average 10 ms almost all night until the failure occurs.</p><p>The traces shown lots of Charter network activity, but nothing that would indicate a specific type of initiated conversation behavior between any Charter system and my router/workstation. The only thing you see just before the pings stop is lots of ARP (but NO USER) activity. After the gateway ping fails, the router starts broadcasting ARP to see where the gateway is, and it continues without ever reconnecting on it's own.</p><p>There appears to be some other attempted connections/browser activity from the router IP that show as retrans during this time. DHCP requests are directed to the wrong server or don't answer. I haven't ruled out possible malware on my network, but even if present - I don't think it's contributing to this problem. Charter's not telling me that they're booting me based on my outbound traffic.</p><p>You have to physically power cycle both the modem and router to re-establish link. Just releasing/renewing the IP on the router won't work. I'm patched to the latest software version on my router. Right now the only solution I have is to give my wife a wireless light switch that has the cable modem and router plugged in, and when the internet doesn't work turn it off and then back on.<br />
</p><p>I had to google a phone support number, but after that opened a support case with Charter, got an English speaking tech on the phone within 5 mins, and started hoping that maybe it wouldn't be so bad. In fact, he determined in less than 5 minutes that if the directly connected PC worked fine, then it HAD TO BE my router and he was done. Sigh.</p><p>I have anonymized my capture with TraceWrangler (cool tool!), and can provide it for analysis. I'm hoping that I have enough info to prove or at least accurately infer what Charter is doing at 5 AM that causes this. I'll probably never get them to admit any fault and unless Buffalo has a suggestion, I most likely will have to continue with the remote power cycling. However, I'm hoping that we can discuss enough detail here to at least shame them publicly and confirm what everybody already suspects - it's not always the user's router. Maybe we can even diagnose the activity to determine if it's something they can do to avoid causing the condition (a change in their procedures), and make the world better for Charter customers. Unless they're TRYING to make you use their router...</p><p>Is this the place to out an ISP? Looking forward to your replies!</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">dhcp charter ping gateway dsl</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>09 Jun '15, 21:20</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0950f468133c72b3e15e65edf5db5ce?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Lucidcryotank&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Lucidcryotank<br />

My data's been anonymized, which means I'll have to do some translation so you know what's what if needed. I already had the info you've requested before I obscurred it. I'll provide that soon. I wanted to use the anonymizer for experience, and think it's not smart to post all of your particulars on the internet. Look for the ICMP source near the beginning, that's from the IP that Charter assigned to my router - and the destination is the gateway that was specified with it. The actual PING source is my PC on the router LAN side.</p><p>I wouldn't ask for you to look at a 100 Mb file, and you don't have to look at all if you don't want to. Sorry if this info was clear in the first post, I thought it was.</p><p>My data: <a href="https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/383ad1bef646">https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/383ad1bef646</a></p><p>I don't have a console or webgui link to the cable modem, so I really don't know what it's doing. I thought is was simply a layer two conversion for the RG6 coax media, and that all of these endpoints were located directly on the subnet with Charter's gateways (they change intermittently, along with my outside IP). I believe my router negotiates through the L2 cable modem link over Charter's subnet with their DHCP server, who then provides the default gateway. It's the same for the PC when it's directly connected to the cable modem and I release/renew my Charter IP.</p><p>The only capture location is my TAP connected inline between the cable modem RJ45 and my router's Internet interface. The PC has a monitor link to the TAP, and data link to the router's inside LAN. When I connect the PC directly, I simply swap it's data network cable for the router's connection to the TAP. I don't know if my connection goes through a Charter firewall before it hits the DHCP server or gateway first, but I doubt it. The cable modem is a Cisco DPC3008, Docsis 3.0, HW V1.0.</p><p>Evidently there's something about the DHCP negotiation using the PC's NIC that is different from the router's, but I believe I have the router configured correctly or an Internet interface release/renew on the router would fail when the link is up and pings to the gateway are working. I'm going to have to start another comment.</p></div><div id="comment-43122-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(13 Jun '15, 13:57)</span> Lucidcryotank</div></div><span id="43131"></span><div id="comment-43131" class="comment"><div id="post-43131-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Here's a drawing.</p><p><img src="https://osqa-ask.wireshark.org/upfiles/CHARTER_cYxqeWq.JPG" alt="alt text" /></p></div><div id="comment-43131-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(13 Jun '15, 23:10)</span> Lucidcryotank</div></div><span id="43132"></span><div id="comment-43132" class="comment"><div id="post-43132-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>In the anonymized data, 199.77.184.213 is my assigned outside IP via DHCP from Charter.

Everything else not sourced from .213 is Charter intra-system traffic, or is network traffic from the internet or Charter hosts. The MAC f2:18:92:af:8c:69 is Charter's edge device, some sort of Cadant system.

I'm going to call this my answer to my own question and close it out. You must get a lot of exercise jumping to conclusions. I didn't say I was going to sue Charter, I'm not that naive. I've been insulted by smarter guys than you before about lots of different network issues, and they were wrong too. Everybody's entitled to their opinion.<br />
</p><p>I think I did prove something here - these problems are NOT the fault of my router or network behind it, and they DO originate from Charter's network. As Laura Chappell or Gerald Coombs would tell you - packets don't lie. HOWEVER, they don't always tell ALL of the truth, depending on where and how they were collected, and when taken out of context. From the packet data I was able to collect from my TAP, I don't think that any of my statements can be ruled out.<br />
</p><p>I never really expected to fix this problem, I just wanted more eyes on the traces to make sure I wasn't missing anything, get used to the forum, play with anonymizing data, use CloudShark, and leave some food for thought about Charter along with solid packet details (my trace) - mission accomplished! So even though I can't prove any of my accusations against Charter, I'm also not the first person to make these same claims. In this case if it's NOT MY ROUTER, then how many other Charter customers are experiencing the same problems - and it's not their routers either? What Charter is doing is WRONG whether by stupid negligence or intent, and more people should know.<br />
</p><p>I won't be taking your recommendation, because that's also what Charter wants and it goes against my moral standards. I'll just keep power cycling for now, wait until AT&amp;T catches up to and matches the price and bandwidth that Charter currently offers, and switch back when they do. Notice I used some all caps words, but stopped short of bolding things and including little winks.

Charter wanted me to remove my router and just have a single workstation connected to see when it would happen again. Unsatisfactory solution for a house with 3 connected adults on phones, laptops, the TV, game consoles, and used to streaming Netflix at night. They didn't like my answer, so they notified the FCC that I was refusing to help them tshoot further.</p><p>HOWEVER... just before that happened, I asked the engineer working on the problem if he thought it might be weather related. I asked him twice and he never answered. So now about 100 yards down my street Charter has their big orange coax looking just like a donkey's tail. The junction boxes are open, and multiple long runs of cable now loop in a daisy chain between the junction boxes. Cabling runs out into the street and lays by the curb until the next junction box, spanning about 8 houses. They are bypassing the existing infrastructure, patching around it with temporary cabling. It looks like a layer one problem to me. Regardless, since they did that a week or so ago, I don't think my cable modem and router have locked one time.</p><p>So I may not absolutely prove that Charter was at fault, or that my router is at fault, but the probs have practically disappeared with the new cabling.

Here the troubleshooting seems a bit all over the place. Not only is it wrong technically to look at DNS as a cause for a failed ping to an IP address (for example), but when you go down that rabbit hole you make a simple problem more complicated needlessly. Trust me, you can spend hours chasing down red herrings if you just start by opening a capture file and looking around at things like this.</p><p>From the trace file, assuming your topology info is correct and your router not being in the same network as your IP gateway is just a result of packet sanitization, we can say for sure that during the service interruption your router could not ping its IP gateway. THAT is something you can potentially take to your ISP without speculating on a cause, and it's a symptom their first-line support should understand. Further, if you see it from the tap leaving your router, it puts all your thoughts on 'network malware' to bed where you can focus on this single L3 hop without speculating on (uncommon) things you suspect they may be doing beyond their CMTS.</p><p>As has been said, there isn't enough information in that trace file to conclude anything. A ping request not responded to after it had been successful in packets 1-2 means that this level of connectivity was lost, but from this there's no way to say why, and no 'tail to be pinned', so to speak, from this stage.</p><p>Having said that, for the comments about ISPs not caring based on the math of one customer's monthly rate versus the support cost of a call, I can't speak for all ISPs but at least for myself I'd never look at it that way. In my experience, if a problem is enough of an outlier to not fit within what initial support lines can troubleshoot, it WILL get to engineering-type support people who would understand what a network tap is fairly quickly (provided it really is an outlier, and not a common problem being over-complicated). Even now where I'm in a design/planning role, and mainly in the the cellular side now, I'll still regularly read through escalated 'one-off' tickets for residential internet service and put an A-game effort in to them because 1) they represent the squeaky wheel of a greater customer base that warrants caring of such wheels and 2) one-off cases reported by individuals can often represent greater problems that few people have reported yet, and I really want to know about those. Many/most network engineering-types feel the same way, and the HFC/Docsis network admins that I know care about every single cable modem.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>18 Jun '15, 19:05</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f533c5f20f9c9afbf4b03de08a100e11?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Quadratic&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Quadratic<br />

It's just my experience, that it often takes very long to find the right people who are able and willing to understand the problem at a technical level. My experience with different ISPs (mostly in Germany) is, that the motivation to look at a problem is directly connected to the service type. If its a highly standardized thing like a Cable link (for home users), that's being sold to millions of customers, your chances to get the right person on the phone is virtually zero. If it's a business type service, it's much more easy, because you'll have the right people to talk to anyway (often dedicated engineers) and they are able to directly look at the routers while you are talking to them. The same is true for small, local ISPs.</p><p>Apparently, every case (and ISP) is different, but my general perception is certainly right for the german market, and I don't think it's totally different in other countries: If the service is highly standardized, with low margins, the motivation to invest too much time for support cases is pretty low. If they would investigate every case <strong>where an end user BELIEVES</strong> to have found a problem with the service, they would virtually drown in support tickets.</p><p>So my whole point is: If a home user of a <strong>large ISP</strong>, with one of those highly standardized services, believes he can <strong>prove</strong> that there is something wrong with the service, then I'm absolutely confident that this will lead to nowhere! You simply won't find the right person who is willing to listen to you, especially if you don't follow their recommendation (please use our own router) and thus you've left the "known paths" of their highly standardized service.</p></div><div id="comment-43368-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(19 Jun '15, 06:55)</span> Kurt Knochner ♦</div></div><span id="43381"></span><div id="comment-43381" class="comment"><div id="post-43381-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Quadratic,</p><p>Thank you so much for contributing some helpful comments from an insider's perspective!</p><p>Note that I never performed any DNS analysis for this event, just made a speculative comment - because there is no DNS traffic to analyze.</p><p>You are correct about the only thing we can say for sure, during the service interruption my router could not ping its IP gateway OR get an ARP back from it. However, when you take that to Charter, all you get it "It's your router, fix it or try ours" - case closed. First line support did/does NOT understand or appear to care.</p><p>As for my possible consideration for malware, I speculated that if possible malware exfiltrating from my network were detected by Charter, they may knock me off on purpose to mitigate what they may consider to be suspicious behavior. I don't think that any of the traffic seen leaving my network could be seen as such, but there were some SSL sessions that couldn't really be analyzed without a key, and I didn't capture full packets in order to get more history. This happens intermittently, on a frequency of every 1-4 days. Also, Charter didn't notify me of any such action, but not sure how they'd do that anyway.</p><p>As far as having evidence and being able to prove that Charter is at fault for anything (accidental or not), I agree that the data from this capture at this location is inconclusive. However, if you read the news yesterday about FCC's lawsuit against AT&amp;T for bandwidth throttling for their unlimited data 4G service, I think it's possible that the FCC could take an interest in this behavior too. I'm curious about what the FCC did to make their case against AT&amp;T, how/what data was obtained, methods of analysis used, etc. All I know for certain is that there were numerous customer complaints.</p><p>I believe there are engineers at ISP's that do care that would analyze these types of probs if they were aware and not prohibited by some internal policy, but there's no escalation or followup when contacting tier 1 support - just the lame mantra "it's your router, try ours". Therefore, it makes Charter's response seem suspiciously to be by design, especially in light of the data. I think I will attempt to contact the FCC to see if they have an interest in this. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. In this case, I'd just be happy to have 3 tier take this issue seriously, do some tshooting, and fix what appears to be Charter's prob. At this point, Charter has shown no interest in doing this.</p></div><div id="comment-43381-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(19 Jun '15, 11:32)</span> Lucidcryotank</div></div><span id="43382"></span><div id="comment-43382" class="comment"><div id="post-43382-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>For any other ISP customer having similar probs and reading this, if you've exhausted all reasonable efforts and end up like I did, here's a URL of interest:</p><p><a href="https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us">https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us</a></p></div><div id="comment-43382-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(19 Jun '15, 11:37)</span> Lucidcryotank</div></div><span id="43388"></span><div id="comment-43388" class="comment"><div id="post-43388-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Not that it will help, but Charters Consumer satisfaction rating is poor even for a cable company, see <a href="http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=149&amp;catid=&amp;Itemid=214&amp;c=Charter+Communications&amp;i=Internet+Service+Providers">here</a> and there seems to be a lot of like minded other customers <a href="http://charter-communications.pissedconsumer.com/">here</a>.</p></div><div id="comment-43388-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(19 Jun '15, 14:41)</span> grahamb ♦</div></div><span id="43394"></span><div id="comment-43394" class="comment"><div id="post-43394-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I've submitted a complaint to the FCC, we'll have to see if/how this process works.

So, you will automatically fall into the 99% for them.</p><p>I've done such investigations in professional environments with business contracts of several thousand $ per month, and even there the ISPs claimed it's not their fault, regardless the fact that the proof was right there in front of them. So, good luck with that approach as a "small home user" ;-))</p><p><strong>However</strong>, I don't want to discourage you. So, if you think you can achieve something, go ahead and post the capture file somewhere, so we can have a look.

I look at packets and perform analysis at work, then come home and focus my skills and attention on what's become an aggravation with my ISP. I've also used enterprise tools on ISP links to large companies to show that their SLA wasn't being met, that they had issues on their circuits, or that QoS wasn't being marked properly. However, I never paid that much attention on my home service, or tried using Wireshark to see the details. I didn't have a TAP to get between the modem and router, but now I do. How/where do I post a PCAP of my data for collaboration?</p><p>How do I determine the cable modem's IP? I don't think it has one, as it seems like my Charter assigned IP's next hop is directly to the subnet gateway. A traceroute to the default gateway for my Charter subnet from the inside workstation shows that it's the very next hop after my LAN gateway, with nothing in between.</p><p>I've been pinging the default gateway for the DHCP subnet sourced from my workstation on the LAN side of my router, but in the capture the ping appears sourced from the Charter IP that my router obtains via DHCP on the internet interface. I also see traffic to several other Charter systems, inlcuding the DHCP servers.</p><p>When my ping to Charter's gateway fails, I see the ICMP request with no reply. If you can't ping the gateway, you can't get out to go anywhere on the internet.</p><p>Anders,</p><p>What you suggested is what I suspect, but I don't understand why a PC would renegotiate successfully after the test and connect, wherease my router won't - as it's fully configured for DHCP to receive DNS and default gateway from Charter, and does so successfully AFTER I hard boot both the cable modem and router.<br />
</p><p>While it's down before the reboot, I can see my router arping for the gateway that it last knew, but an arp response is never received. This happens whether the subnet changes or stays the same after a power cycle and reconnect. It's like whatever they do breaks the arp process and/or DHCP negotiation from my router through the cable modem to Charter's edge. I don't know why Charter isn't responding to my router's arp to find the previously working (or any other) gateway, or sending out DHCP offers after whatever it is they do. I'v cloned the MAC from my originally connected workstation, and I don't understand why Charter's systems would discriminate against me until both a cable modem and router reboot. I'm trying to see if any of the captured data analyzed in Wireshark can provide any clues, but I'm not sure what else to look at that may be significant - and I understand that the actual problem may not leave any evidence in the PCAP data. I'm really just checking to see.</p></div><div id="comment-43056-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(10 Jun '15, 22:29)</span> Lucidcryotank</div></div><span id="43057"></span><div id="comment-43057" class="comment"><div id="post-43057-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>There may be a Charter DNS component for the failure to renegotiate as well, but that isn't apparent to me from the packet data.</p></div><div id="comment-43057-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(10 Jun '15, 22:34)</span> Lucidcryotank</div></div><span id="43060"></span><div id="comment-43060" class="comment"><div id="post-43060-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>How/where do I post a PCAP of my data for collaboration?</p></blockquote><p>google drive, dropbox, cloudshark.org.

Before that, the router just keeps broadcasting ARP to find the gateway, and DHCP requests by the router go unanswered. In the trace, the reboot happens around packet 11391.</p><p>I think it's possible that there's a DNS issue after getting knocked off (see packet 94 - 05:15:11.277 CST) where the Charter systems can't resolve their own IP's on my original subnet after the event (seems like some sort of resolution problem, at least temporarily), and that's why the expected systems can't respond to an ARP or DHCP request from my router - at least as long as my router still has the old IP, gateway, and DNS configured.<br />
</p><p>That's just a guess, I could be wrong, not sure you can prove that from the packet details. It doesn't make sense that a router internet link release/renew doesn't work without rebooting the cable modem after the event, unless the modem got latched in some sort of confused state - which I think happened on their end instead of mine.<br />
</p><p>I don't know what Charter does whenever they move you to another DHCP server and gateway, or why the PC would recover without rebooting the modem and the router wouldn't.<br />
</p><p>I say the PC recovers. The pings don't seem to go down at all when it's connected alone. I couldn't find a time when the pings failed to respond. I haven't looked very closely at that, I'd need to swap router/PC and live without my router long enough for it for the event to hopefully occur, and then find any evidence of a ping drop - which didn't make an obvious appearance when looking at the pingplotter responses for PC only connection traffic.</p></div><div id="comment-43125-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(13 Jun '15, 14:39)</span> Lucidcryotank</div></div><span id="43126"></span><div id="comment-43126" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-43126-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I want to know for sure if my router is the problem (what Charter says), or not.

Before I anonymized the data, and before the event when the gateway pings failed (earlier in the original data, trimmed out), there was a specific host IP on a different subnet from anything else seen. Charter DNS servers couldn't resolve the IP to a name. It is the source of the ARP requests to many different subnets. In another trace this resolved at layer 2 to a Cadant DSL system, Charter's edge, arp proxy that appears to be tasked with checking to see who all of the live systems are in whatever broadcast domain this is for multiple, non-contiguous IP subnets. In every case it was ARP'ing to get specific network IP's to talk back to their gateways. The first 3 packets from 100-102 are my router arping to that specific IP/Cadant system. The rest are simply to the subnet as the first 3 tries to the Cadant system failed. I'm not sure why my router tried the Cadant first, unless that's the last system that told my router to report it's IP to the subnet gateway.</p><p>Did you get an IP address in the range of 192.168.x.x? no.</p><p>If not, I would not fully understand those ARP requests.

The first TCP frames are retrans from my router to yv-in-f188.1e100.net, identitifed as hpvroom traffic. They are PSH ACK's, so that means they're supposed to be expedited. I have no idea what traffic this traffic is - sourced from either inside my network or from my FW. Maybe my cel phone, checking something in the background. It appears to part of or similar to some earlier communication. The original packet is #134. It seems that these retrans never reach their destination. This is true for all other traffic sourced from my router's IP in the trace - you see some first packets of traffic destined for Amazon or Google, then retrans.</p></div><div id="comment-43225-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 Jun '15, 19:46)</span> Lucidcryotank</div></div><span id="43226"></span><div id="comment-43226" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-43226-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I'll try just rebooting the cable modem next time, but I don't think my router will release and renew until the lease is up - so I'd be down until then unless I managed the router to do that.

</p><p>It's also easier and cheaper to do this than pay Charter extra each month to insult my router, network, and me for the privilege of stopping outages that are simply caused because I'm not running their router. I'm not connecting a business or hosting a webserver, etc. - so while outages are aggravating, fixing it isn't worth renting Charter's router to me. I do believe that Charter may be intentionally using some methodology to determine that I have a router, it's not theirs, and they're trying to coerce their customers into renting Charter gear instead of using their own router by configuring and managing their systems WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE/DESIGN FOR THE EFFECT, to knock folks off in this fashion. If you're connected using a single PC and nothing appears to be routed from behind it based on some analysis they perform on your traffic, they leave you alone.</p><p>I also disagree that there's nothing that can be determined from these traces. I think it's obvious that the problem ISN'T on my router, that it's activity on Charter's network, and therefore something Charter is either accidentally or intentionally doing (the latter is my opinion) that causes it.</p></div><div id="comment-43226-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 Jun '15, 20:03)</span> Lucidcryotank</div></div><span id="43227"></span><div id="comment-43227" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-43227-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I think that Charter has done this in such a fashion to also purposely mask what they're doing - as if it could be proved, I think it could result in a class action lawsuit against them for upselling you to rent their router in order to consistently access the 100 Mb link for all the devices in your home that you already paid for.</p></div><div id="comment-43227-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 Jun '15, 20:08)</span> Lucidcryotank</div></div><span id="43243"></span><div id="comment-43243" class="comment"><div id="post-43243-score" class="comment-score">1</div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>I think it could result in a class action lawsuit against them</p></blockquote><p>I'm sorry, but I believe you are heading into the totally wrong direction. Are you serious? You are thinking about to start a lawsuit, which will cost you (at least) several thousand $, for a 50 $ cable link? How are you going to prove any of your accusations/assumptions in court?</p><p>I'm sorry, but I stay with my last recommendation:</p><p>Ask Charter to send you their router. If the problem still persists, you can blame them until they have fixed the problem and then they have no excuse to refuse support ;-)</p></div><div id="comment-43243-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(17 Jun '15, 04:57)</span> Kurt Knochner ♦</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-43032" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 18 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 13 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-43032-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
