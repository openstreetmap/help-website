I'm new to using WS and have resorted to it due to the fact that I'm having some major pains with connectivity, that I believe are related to my ISP. My connection is consistent, but, stutters and stumbles. One minute it is performing like the 10/10 connection it is, then the next minute it might perform like dial up. I can't put my finger on it and can't understand all the data that WS is gathering. Is there a way to automate analysis of the capture in order to get a comprehensive assessment of it? Just a thought.

ISP isn't seeing an issue when they check, but, neither was I, at that time. I've replaced my Sonicwall with a Netgear SOHO as a trial. Same results. Replaced patch cable from router to wall(fiber to home). No internal modem from ISP. Bypassed router entirely, same issues. Switched NIC's on my PC, same results. Wired or wireless, same results. I decided to try WS as a method to prove to ISP that there is an issue with their line, maybe card beginning to fail at a switching station.....just not sure.
