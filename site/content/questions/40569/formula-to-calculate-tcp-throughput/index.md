not the throughput. so if they say it's a dedicated link for backup i think i could apply this BGP calculation and based on this calculate the max achievable possible throughput but again i might sound like a drunk monkey right now. but i'm not sure if the Windows Copy rate can be compared to the backups job rate (boh represent goodput ?). so you see, i have like billions of question in my head but to be honest only you guys out there so i really do appreciate any help.</p><p>Edit: i don't demand from people to teach me everything from scratch without moving a**. NO, i spent hours even on weekends to learn, all i need is sometimes to clear my doubts to confirm something. But i think if I'm the Level 1 guy and not even the Level 3 guys can do it hmm, that's not as it supposed to be i guess.</p></div><div id="comment-40593-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(15 Mar '15, 13:05)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">adasko</span></div></div><span id="40594"></span><div id="comment-40594" class="comment"><div id="post-40594-score" class="comment-score">1</div><div class="comment-text"><p>Okay, I see. So there is a real world problem behind all this. Calculating BDP is a theoretical thing, because it's rare that only a single TCP connection utilizes a link, but it may be an interesting number to know what the maximum Window size is.</p><p>BDP was much more important with Windows XP and earlier, because starting with Vista, the TCP stack does Window Scaling automatically. With XP, it often happened that the Window size was too small without enabling RFC 1323 options in the registry. So if the OS version involved are Vista/Server 2008 or newer, you can assume that the TCP stack does Window scaling.</p><p>There are two problems with Window sizes: one is when it's too small, forcing the sender to pause transmission. The other is when it's too big, leading to packet loss because the infrastructure gets overloaded. Both have specific symptoms you can observe in a capture. Window sizes too small result in "Window Full" messages and long delays. Window sizes too big result in massive packet loss and Duplicate ACKs that go up into hundreds or even thousands for the same sequence number.</p><p>Windows file copies have improved with SMB2 and SMB3, but its hard to compare to another transfer when you don't know how it behaves.</p><p>If I were you I'd try to get traces of the slow connections when a customer complains. With the actual packets it should be possible to determine where the problem is (Window size too big or too small).</p><p>With a 10G connection it may also be the backup target, because if that connection is fully utilized you're talking about writing at a maximum speed of 1.3GByte per second to disk. Trouble is, it could be hard to actually capture a full speed 10GBps transaction, because that requires specialized capture hardware.</p></div><div id="comment-40594-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(15 Mar '15, 13:25)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Jasper ♦♦</span></div></div><span id="40596"></span><div id="comment-40596" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-40596-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>not sure whether I'm allowed to take traces like Wireshark and as you wrote with a 10G network would need to have special hardware . may i ask you if this applies also for other standards like 1 G , FastEthernet is this a Wireshark limitation ( i suspect that the capture hardware need sufficient CPU, RAM etc.) is there any official wireshark KB on this ?<br />

The HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\TCPWindowSize and HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interface\InterfaceGUID\TCPWindowSize registry values can be set to a maximum of 65,535 bytes (without window scaling) or 1,073,741,823 (with window scaling). Third, the maximum receive window size can use window scaling. You can enable window scaling by setting the HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Tcp1323Opts registry value to 1 or 3.</p><p>i cannot find any of those reg keys on Windows 7 and Windows 2008 r2 Server (you also mentioned this, so this is clear for me ).</p><p>but</p><p>"To optimize TCP throughput, especially for transmission paths with a high BDP, the Next Generation TCP/IP stack in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008) supports Receive Window Auto-Tuning. "</p><p>"The Next Generation TCP/IP stack no longer uses the TCPWindowSize registry value. Receive Window Auto-Tuning has a number of benefits. It automatically determines the optimal receive window size on a per-connection basis. In Windows XP, the TCPWindowSize registry value applies to all connections. Applications no longer need to specify TCP window sizes through Windows Sockets options. And IT administrators no longer need to manually configure a TCP receive window size for specific computers."</p><p>source:</p><p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.01.cableguy.aspx">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.01.cableguy.aspx</a></p><p>so now i'm wondering ... if we are unable to set / modify the window size value on any OS above XP/2003 how the heck we can deal with for example a Window Size to small case. so based on a Wireshark capture i can tell that this is the reason but what about the cause . so like you wrote your example with the 4G modem card forcing a 4 MB Window.</p><p>also "Applications no longer need to specify TCP window sizes through Windows Sockets options" so if i'm not wrrong we have no option to change the Window Size on the newer MS OS's because all what we could previous adjust manually this is handled right now by the new TCP/IP stack.</p><p>also are you aware of any type of documentation describing the initial process of detreming the Window Size on both ends ? i found something related to Windows CE (what the heck is this ) but i think it's not valid</p></div><div id="comment-40622-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 Mar '15, 13:59)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">adasko</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-40576" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 17 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 12 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-40576-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
