One well-defined message from protocol PLUGIN in your case. If that PDU is segmented by TCP, it can span multiple TCP segments (and therefor multiple frames). The function <code>tcp_dissect_pdus()</code> is used to reassemble your PDU. But it does this by handing it a function that can determine the length of your PDU within the first X bytes of the data. Does your protocol work like that? Is there a length value somewhere in the first bytes of each PDU? If not, you can not use <code>tcp_dissect_pdus()</code>.</p></div><div id="comment-18085-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(30 Jan '13, 02:04)</span> SYN-bit ♦♦</div></div><span id="18086"></span><div id="comment-18086" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-18086-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Without looking at the trace and dissector it is really hard to tell you why it does not work... unless one has a crystal ball of course ;-)</p></div><div id="comment-18086-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(30 Jan '13, 02:05)</span> SYN-bit ♦♦</div></div><span id="18093"></span><div id="comment-18093" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-18093-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Yeah I understand it hard..

If packet N in one direction has a "next sequence number" of X, and the next packet in that direction has a "next sequence number" of Y and Y &gt; X, and there's no later packet that contains bytes with sequence numbers from X to Y, then there's a missing packet (perhaps present on the network but not captured, perhaps not even present on the network). If there <em>is</em> such a packet later, the packets were delivered out of order; Wireshark might not handle that correctly.</p></div><div id="comment-18846-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(25 Feb '13, 03:06)</span> Guy Harris ♦♦</div></div><span id="18848"></span><div id="comment-18848" class="comment"><div id="post-18848-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>"and there's no later packet that contains bytes with sequence numbers from X to Y", Do you mean by that, that there is no reassembled packet after couple of "[TCP segment of a reassembled PDU]"?</p><p>As I said in "2." , I can see a packet of "[TCP segment of a reassembled PDU]", that it's value of "TCP segment data" is exactly my desired packet, but somehow there is no reassembled packet after it, and wireshark doesn't dissect it as my message :/</p></div><div id="comment-18848-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(25 Feb '13, 06:10)</span> hudac</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-18841" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-18841-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
