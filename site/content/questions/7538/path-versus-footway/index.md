<p>I've been adding some local hiking trails in my area. After looking around it looked like Path was the right thing to use, but I keep finding other trails in the area marked as footways. These are definitely hiking paths and not things for pedestrians walking to the store. So two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How should trails be labelled? Path? Footway? something else?</li>
<li>If it should be something other than footway, should I change these other trails I come across? What is the etiquette? Thanks</li>

<p>Thanks for the responses. I had looked through the documentation, but your explanations really help and make it very clear. I'll start moving my trails to footway.</p>

<p>It might be worth having a read of <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/647/sk53">SK53</a>'s answer to <a href="/questions/7015/tagging-public-footpaths-for-routing">this question</a>. Ignore the the England-and-Wales specific stuff (we have "Public Footpaths" here - a curious system of legalised access across other people's land) but the Path vs Footway comments should still apply.</p>
<p>As Frederik says, "footway" just means "mainly/exclusively for pedestrians" - there's no presumption that it's a nicely surfaced footpath in a city as opposed to a rough hiking path (or vice versa).</p>
<p>"path" just means "not wide enough to be a track". There are a bunch of other tags that you can use with "path" to give more information, but "highway=path" on its own doesn't really say much.</p>
<p>There's more detail about the general approach (from Richard) <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Duck_tagging">here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, it's also worth talking to other local mappers. In your case they seem to be mainly using "footway", but in some places they may have decided as a group that "highway=path" (with other tags as appropriate) best fits local usage and laws.</p>
<p>On the etiquette thing, personally if I find a hiking trail locally that I'd normally map as "highway=footway" mapped by another mapper as "highway=path" I wouldn't normally change it but would try and add tags to make it more clear what it was, simply on the grounds that life's too short for unproductive arguments.</p>

<p>Our wiki certainly isn't gospel but it doesn't hurt to look things up there. On the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway">Key:highway page</a> you'll find the statement that <code>highway=footway</code> is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>for designated footpaths; i.e., mainly/exclusively for pedestrians. <strong>This includes walking tracks and gravel paths.</strong> If bicycles are allowed as well, you can indicate this by adding a bicycle=yes tag. Should not be used for paths where the primary or intended usage is unknown.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(emphasis added), and I believe in this case the wiki reflects mapping reality well. It is ok to use <code>highway=path</code> if you prefer but for a hiking trail people would usually qualify that with something like <code>foot=designated</code> or so, depending on the signage.</p>
