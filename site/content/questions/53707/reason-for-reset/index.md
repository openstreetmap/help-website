So you should take two captures simultaneously (to be absolutely sure that you'd be analysing the same session) at client side and at your side, and if these captures confirm that both ends receive the RST, you would have to track down the device between them which kills the session.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>29 Jun '16, 00:48</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/00fc6e2633725bd871ff636f0175eabc?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="sindy&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>sindy<br />

If between Radware and server, can you capture simultaneously at both sides of the Radware, before bothering the client? The result will then tell you whether to concentrate on the Radware (if it sends RST to both ends of the TCP session) or whether to capture simultaneously at the client and at the client-facing side of the Radware to find out whether something between the client workstation and the Radware (e.g., the client's firewall) is sending RST bi-directionally.</p></div><div id="comment-53718-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(29 Jun '16, 04:03)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="53740"></span><div id="comment-53740" class="comment"><div id="post-53740-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>hi, i capture form my server 192.168.5.107 need to capture at both side to know the root cause ?</p></div><div id="comment-53740-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(29 Jun '16, 21:53)</span> suarez123</div></div><span id="53741"></span><div id="comment-53741" class="comment"><div id="post-53741-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Ηι,</p><pre><code>     client --- firewall --- internet --- radware --- server
