<p>If you want to roughly move it I would suggest using the JOSM editor: it allows more rapid selection of large number of objects than Potlatch (the online editor). You can select multiple objects with Potlatch using Shift-click, but it can be frustrating to lose a large selection through inadvertently clicking in the wrong place.</p>
<p>However, looking at Petersburg, I think you'd be faster realigning by hand. You have typical poor TIGER data, but with a manageable volume of data. The simplify line tool (bottom left in the tool menu) in the on-line editor Potlatch will help. I'd drag the intersections to their correct locations, and then use the simplify line tool to straighten out each street.</p>
<p>A far bigger job is getting the coastline more accurate, and this needs to be done by hand anyway.</p>
