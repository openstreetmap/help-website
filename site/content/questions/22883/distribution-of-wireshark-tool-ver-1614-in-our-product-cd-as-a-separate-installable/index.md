</p></blockquote><p>Long story short: Yes, you can distribute Wireshark as part of your CD, as long as you follow the rules of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL license</a></p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p><p>Just a few more hints (simplified version of the GPL - as I understand it).</p><p>You can use/distribute Wireshark, even in a commercial environment</p><ul><li>as long as you don't modify the product and you make clear that it is an open source product and not <strong>your</strong> product (e.g. don't make it look like it is your product by replacing icons/texts with company icons/texts and the like)</li><li>if you extend the functionality of the product you <strong>must</strong> make the code changes publicly available, if you distribute or sell the modified product</li><li>if use code of the product to build/extend your own products, you <strong>must</strong> make the code of your own products publicly available, if you distribute or sell that product</li><li>If you use the product only internally (no selling, no distribution, no making available in any sense), you can change the product however you like, without the need to make those changes publicly available.</li></ul><p>Regards<br />
Kurt</p><p>One more GPL hint:</p><ul><li>You must allow anybody who receives the version of Wireshark on your product CD to give away that version of Wireshark to anybody they want, including people who haven't purchased your product, and must allow them to give away the source to that version of Wireshark. (This will <em>NOT</em>, as far as I know, require you to give away the source to your own software on the same CD, as bundling Wireshark with that software will, I think, count as "mere aggregation" of the two pieces of software, to use the term used in the GPL. However, I am not a lawyer, so, as per Kurt's suggestion, you should ask your corporate lawyers about all this.</li></ul><p>Guy Harris</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>12 Jul '13, 00:43</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23b7bf5b13bc2c98b2e8aa9869ca5d75?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Kurt%20Knochner&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Kurt Knochner ♦<br />

    Section 2 says that modified versions you distribute must be licensed to all third parties under the GPL. “All third parties” means absolutely everyone — but this does not require you to *do* anything physically for them. It only means they have a license from you, under the GPL, for your version. </code></pre><p>So, <strong>if you release</strong> a modified version, you <strong>must</strong> license that version to <strong>absolutely everyone</strong>. 'Licensing' (in the context of GPL) means also access to the full source code.</p><p>Secondly, there is an organization called <a href="http://www.gpl-violations.org/">GPL violations</a>. They track the use of GPL code in commercial projects. Then they ask those companies to disclose the whole source code <strong>to the public</strong>. If they deny that, they will be sued. GPL violations has already won some law suits, despite the term above: <code>but this does not require you to *do* anything physically for them.</code>.
