<p>I live in North Carolina, USA. We have 100 Counties, about 12 of them maintain data on neighborhoods (subdivisions). With property tax records, I can isolate all neighborhoods with a listing of their streets. I use this in a larger database where we can find and create routes for every neighborhood in the County.</p>
<p>In Counties that do not offer that information, I am at a loss. I would like to make an Excel file on each of the Counties and have the neighborhood name in one column and the street name in the next. With that information I could integrate the file into my database and every customer would be moved into a specific neighborhood and by using the individual street numbers I could make a delivery route.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to have a separate file for each county, although I believe there are more streets in North Carolina than one Excel file will hold.</p>

<p>Or delete your old question.</p>
<p>Is the neighborhood information in Openstreetmap? And if so, as a node or a polygon. Do you really need a neighborhood? It sounds like you just want to have some spatial clusters. You could then just define some neighborhoods yourself too (obviously outside of OSM).</p>
