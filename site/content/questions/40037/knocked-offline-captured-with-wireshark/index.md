That is, the attack would come from multiple IP addresses. Unless the other player controls a botnet, this was probably an idle threat. If you were the victim of a DDOS attack, you might be able to spot it in a Wireshark trace, but the IP addresses would be the bots that attacked you, not the IP address of the system that launched the attack.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>23 Feb '15, 18:36</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/071fe61f64868d98bdf4eb060b63b6ca?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Jim%20Aragon&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Jim Aragon<br />
