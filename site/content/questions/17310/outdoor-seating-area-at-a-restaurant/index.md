<p>I'm trying to map a restaurant that is mostly inside a building but during nice weather they have a garden area that they seat and serve people in. The main building is unquestionably an amenity=restaurant and building=yes, so I don't have a problem there. The question is how to handle the outdoor area.</p>
<p>I find on the "amenity=pub" page of the wiki that there are options for beer_garden, which this really isn't, and outdoor_seating "for urban situations where one can't really describe the seating as garden-like", except that the area I'm tagging really is garden-like. But still, I'd be ok with outdoor_seating except I'm not sure what to put it on. The description on amenity=pub implies that the beer_garden tag goes on the main restaurant, with the garden as a separate area---but how to tag it? I have tentatively tagged it as a park with access=private but this seems unsatisfying.</p>
<p>(The areas in question, by the way, are <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/188386279">188386279</a> and <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/188386281">188386281</a> if you want to take a look.)</p>

<p>Draw a closed way around the whole restaurant (building + outdoor + whatever else) and tag <em>that</em> with amenity=restaurant, name=Mario's, cuisine=italian, etc. The building's way should probably only have the building=yes tag. If you want you can map the other parts, like a "leisure=garden, access=customers" area, but the main thing is to understand that "the restaurant" is the big area that emcompasses all the smaller features.</p>
<p>This practice is common with amenities like schools, which often comprise multiple buildings, pitches, parkings, etc.</p>
