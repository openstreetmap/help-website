<p>Good Evening,</p>
<p>I need to obtain a full map for a small urban area, according to OSM basemap symbology (such as the one that is applied to the OSM basemaps available through arcgis or qgis) and full vector content. For instance, regarding an urban street, in the basemaps its pavement appears as an area/polygon, there are grey areas between a building and the street area that are probably sidewalks... I need those shapes that I visualize in WMS basemaps, but as vector data that I can use for geoprocessing in gis (such as clipping other datasets). How can I obtain this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help on this issue</p>
