<p>Hello. I am a map lover who has been editing OSM on and off for about a year now, but still very much a beginner, and this is my first post here, so I apologize if it's poorly formatted.</p>
<p>I'm looking for advice on how to best label rather non-traditional neighborhoods in Texas known as <em>colonias</em>.</p>
<p>First, here's a bit of background on what a <em>colonia</em> is. Most <em>colonias</em> began as cheap farmland outside city limits (and therefore not subject to city taxes) bought by land developers and sold in parcels at affordable prices usually to poor immigrants from Mexico usually without utilities like water and power. Most colonias remain very poor and underdeveloped outside of city limits, with the largest concentration existing in the Rio Grande Valley region.</p>
<p>Here are some links if you would like to learn more to get a better understanding of what these are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonia_(United_States)">From Wikipedia</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/01/30/feature/people-living-in-texas-border-enclaves-are-unsure-of-future/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.6a0b99a32512">From The Washington Post</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, currently these places are labeled as <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/26.2471/-98.2784">hamlets</a>; however, I feel that these communities don't fit the hamlet label well and that the map becomes rather cluttered with the boundary-less label. I have found an <a href="https://coloniadata.oag.state.tx.us/">online database</a> from the state that gives boundaries for the <em>colonias</em>.</p>
<p>So, back to the point of my post. What label best fits these unincorporated communities? And what would be the best way to map them? Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<p>The <strong><code>place=hamlet</code></strong> nodes are a relic of an import of names from GNIS, and the tag choice was never terribly reliable (I remember inner-city industrial areas of Pittsburgh being so marked).</p>
<p>Given the size of the colonias in your representative area I would suggest mapping them as <strong><code>landuse=residential</code></strong> and <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:place%3Dneighbourhood"><strong><code>place=neighbourhood</code></strong></a>.</p>
<p>It may also be beneficial, or just plain interesting, to use some kind of sub tag such as <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key%3Aresidential"><strong><code>residential=</code></strong></a> or <strong><code>residential_type=</code></strong> with value <strong><code>texas_colonia</code></strong> or <strong><code>us_colonia</code></strong> to make it easier to pick them out. Other possibilities are marking them as informal_settlement and then specifying colonia as the type of informal settlement. Tagging in this area is not well developed, but it is clearly advantageous to provide the information in some form.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would suggest adding a page on the OSM wiki about these places. This could provide additional relevant information than just a discussion here</p>
