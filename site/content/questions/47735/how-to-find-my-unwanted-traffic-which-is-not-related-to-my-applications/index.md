Even then, part of the traffic may be "legal" because various applications come bundled with daemons which are started at system boot and check for updates even though the application itself is not running.</p><p>When you've done what you could to get rid of "legal" traffic, capture using Wireshark for a while (if you are hunting for malware, I'd recommend to run the capture at least overnight) to see what continues to communicate.</p><p>After stopping the capture, you have to identify remote IP addresses of all the individual TCP streams and use a whois client or some online service (like e.g. <a href="https://www.whatismyip.com/ip-whois-lookup/">this one</a>) to tell you to whom these IP addresses belong. If the owner is a renowned company which is a vendor of some of the applications you have installed, chances are high (but not 100 %) that the traffic is a check for updates; if the owner is some internet service provider, chances are high (but not 100 %) that your machine is a part of some botnet (here I remind again that this is only true if none of your applications was running during the capture, as some applications work on peer-to-peer basis).</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>23 Nov '15, 00:47</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/00fc6e2633725bd871ff636f0175eabc?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="sindy&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>sindy<br />

To make sure, please identify the iPhone's MAC address (the iOS should disclose it to you somewhere in network settings, or your WiFi router's web interface should show a list of connected devices somewhere), open the capture you're taken before and apply a display filter <code>eth.addr == xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx</code> (replace xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx with your iPhone's MAC address of course). Only if some packets are still visible in the packet list when this display filter is active, it makes sense to proceed with this capture. Otherwise most of the traffic in the capture comes from the machine on which you were taking the capture and none from the iPhone.
