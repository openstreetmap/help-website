I click on the "File" menu and leave my mouse hovering on the word "File". The word "Open" (which is the first option in the File menu) is black text on grey background. When I move my mouse down from "File" and hover on the word "Open", the word "Open" changes to black text on a dark blue background. Therefore, it's hard to read what you're hovering on. The only reason this is problematic is because I read with my mouse. My eyes follow my mouse cursor. Maybe I'm weird that way, but I haven't successfully retrained my brain in all these years, so I'm finally reaching out for help.</p><p>Here's my Wireshark version:</p><p>Version 1.10.2 (SVN Rev 51934 from /trunk-1.10)</p><p>Copyright 1998-2013 Gerald Combs [email protected] and contributors.

I am using the classic Win 2000 look-and-feel on my Windows 7 computer. Therefore, when I hover, there is not a "slight highlighting", but a "defined, strong highlighting". I asked a coworker with the Win2000 skin if he experienced the same problem and he did. I then asked a different coworker with the standard Win7 skin if he sees the problem and he does not. His menu items look good because his highlighting is "slight".</p><p>At least I now know why this is the case. I just went to the "Window Color and Appearance" settings in Windows and was able to change the "Selected Items" color as a workaround. I also changed the "Menu" color as a second workaround.</p><p>The strange thing is, that when using the Win2000 skin, other applications work normally. I will use the Notepad menu as an example: While using the Win2000 skin, when I click "File" inside Notepad, the word "New" is black-on-grey. When I hover on "New", it changes to white-on-blue. This seems to indicate that the OS is controlling the coloring, both when not-highlighted and when highlighted. However Wireshark seems to honor the background coloring and the foreground coloring only when not-highlighted, and honors only the background color when highlighted.</p><p>Interesting.</p></div><div id="comment-25552-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(02 Oct '13, 12:54)</span> jrh_mn</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-25544" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-25544-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
