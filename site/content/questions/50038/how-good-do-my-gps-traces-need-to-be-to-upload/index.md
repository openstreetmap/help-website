<p>I recently visited <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/49.5067/-123.7493">a local Provincial Park</a> and did some mapping there. I took a few GPS tracks on my phone. The area has very few GPS tracks at present, nothing with enough resolution to be useful for mapping. I took the tracks while on foot, and walked on roads, trails, and through open grassy areas. As such the GPS track isn't very meaningful for people other than me. I can understand what section was just wandering across open areas, and disregard that section, for others it's less clear.</p>
<p>Should I upload the GPX files anyways?</p>

<p>You could split the difference and clip out the section that you don't think is very helpful before uploading.</p>
<p>You can do this in JOSM by converting the GPX to data, editing the trace and converting back to GPX. Or <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/EditGpx">install a plugin</a>. I guess other GPX tools will work too.</p>
<p>I think even if you don't edit it down, uploading a trace with some parts that don't follow a path or road is fine.</p>

<p>Thank you! I'd not realised how straightforward it was to trim GPX files like that. I will trim off the sections of me wandering aimlessly through the open grassy areas, and upload the remaining sections.</p>
