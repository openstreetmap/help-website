Wireshark (or, rather, the libpcap library it uses) taps into the OS's mechanism for grabbing raw link-layer packets on UN*X and, with the help of the WinPcap driver, taps into Windows NDIS (or, rather, WinPcap taps into NDIS) for getting copies of raw link-layer packets on Windows. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb250446(v=vs.85).aspx">Fiddler acts as a Web proxy</a>, pretending to the browser to be the Web server and pretending to the Web server to be the browser, which allows it to decrypt the traffic with much less difficulty.</p></div><div id="comment-49919-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(06 Feb '16, 00:07)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Guy Harris ♦♦</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-49903" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 8 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 3 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-49903-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
