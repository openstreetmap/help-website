<p>Hi I have this Question, In open street map Major Namibian Towns are not displayed in the overview. I undesrtand this is because a place is shown at a certain zoom level according wheter it is, a town a city or a village. Namibia does not have many Cities and so the Overwiew is Quite empty. Would it be Ok to Tag major Places like Capital town of regions as Cities. So they will display on the overviw? I am thinking about a few like Katima Mulilo, Opuwo, Otjiwarongo Tsumeb etc. The other way I could do this is by using replacements when compiling the map. But I wonder If the community wold prefer that I edit the Map.</p>

<p>It's a fine line. You don't want to misrepresent the facts just in order to achieve a specific rendering result. However, in this particular case, the definition on our Wiki says for <code>place=city</code>:</p>
<p><em>The largest urban settlements in the territory, normally including the national, state and provincial capitals. These are defined by charter or other governmental designation in some territories and are a matter of judgement in others. Should normally have a population of at least 100,000 people and be larger than nearby towns.</em></p>
<p>So if you have a place that is of relative importance compared to the surroundings, but doesn't quite reach 100,000 citizens or doesn't have a governmental designation of "city", it might still be ok to tag it as a city.</p>

<p>Ok so I guess the best is to just declare the capitals of the different regions as City. And to leave the other towns as they are else it will become a bit difficult to define what is a City and what not. And people may feel left out. There are already some places marked as City that should not. So let us wait and see what others say. Just want to find out what should be changed on Openstreetmaps. It is probably better that I get the other places that I would like to see as a city by using replacements when rendering the maps.</p>
