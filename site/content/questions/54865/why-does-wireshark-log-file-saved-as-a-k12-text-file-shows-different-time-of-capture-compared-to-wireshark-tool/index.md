If yes, it is enough to explain why the DST is not taken into account, which may be related to your operating system settings.</p></div><div id="comment-54880-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 Aug '16, 13:08)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="54882"></span><div id="comment-54882" class="comment"><div id="post-54882-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Hi Sindy, Thanks for your inputs.
