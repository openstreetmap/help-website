The essence is that the same way like the server-side TCP port distinguishes between different services using TCP transport, the MPLS label distinguishes between virtual paths, each potentially carrying a different protocol.</p><p>So the requirement above is quite similar to "I want to be able to tell Wireshark to decode all TCP packets as HTTP because I have lots of HTTP packets using various TCP ports at server side". Both make sense in particular context but it is not a typical application case.</p><p>You may want to file a "nice to have" category bug at <a href="https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/">Wireshark bugzilla</a>, asking for a generic mechanism allowing this; some kind of reserved index value (such as <code>other</code>) for the dissector tables might be a useful way allowing you to set a default dissector (using <code>Decode as...</code> or Lua <code>dissectortable:add</code>) which could still be overridden by the individual ones.</p><p>Until someone implements this or something alike, you'll have to run <code>dissectortable:add</code> in a cycle in Lua to fill the relevant dissector table with pointers to the same dissector for all possible index values. I admit that for a 20-bit MPLS label, doing so may take some time and use some memory.</p></div><div id="comment-49901-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(05 Feb '16, 12:52)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div><span id="49905"></span><div id="comment-49905" class="comment"><div id="post-49905-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks. It is good to know there is no easy solution here. I guess this is more because of the way MPLS header is designed. There is no indication on what the payload would be.

The real applications using MPLS don't need to guess because they know. The sending application (if we may call an edge router an application) knows what label to assign to the traffic, the receiving application knows what kind of payload it expects, and the transit elements between these two endpoints don't care, because they just choose the interface to which to forward a packet up to the value of the label and it is irrelevant for them what the payload is. So any kind of explicit payload type identifier included into each packet would be just a waste of bandwidth.</p></div><div id="comment-49906-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(05 Feb '16, 13:57)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div><span id="49966"></span><div id="comment-49966" class="comment"><div id="post-49966-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>It is not only for monitoring applications.

So even if the transit LSR has to analyse the packet contents in order to choose between several possible routes, the contents encapsulation scheme is invariant for any given label, and so the LSR should not depend on heuristic when handling packets but should get the information about the encapsulation scheme the same way it has got the information about its local route set for that label.</p></div><div id="comment-49985-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(08 Feb '16, 13:22)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-49881" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 6 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 1 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-49881-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
