If it's a "normal" protocol plugin it should work to do as you have described if the plugin was developed with the same verion of Wireshark as the installed one. How did it "not work out"? Did you receive any error output? If you start wireshark from the build directory is your protocol available then? If not you may have done something wrong. Which in Wireshark version are you doing your development? Have you compared your Makefiles with other plugins?</p></div><div id="comment-38303-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 Dec '14, 04:29)</span> Anders ♦</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-38302" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-38302-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
