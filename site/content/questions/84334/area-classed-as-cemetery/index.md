<p>Visited again and talked to local, he said all memorials were taken away and probably all mortal remains as well, referred to it as the Nun’s cemetery. Also said no permission for development, owned by some church or other. Is there a category for ex-cemeteries? Have asked mapper if maproulette said it was a cemetery.</p>
