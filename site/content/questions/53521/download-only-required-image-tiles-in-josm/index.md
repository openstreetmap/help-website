<p>When I am working on a task in JOSM, I want to download the satellite imagery for active area of working only. Usually when I zoom out, a lot of other tiles from surrounding area starts to download and for high resolution imagery it takes a lot of time so I want to download only the specific tiles that I am working with. How do I do that? Is there a plugin or other options for that? Thank you.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any plugin to do what you want. I see two workarounds here:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>JOSM should use its cache. You might be able to first load the images into the cache by browsing around in JOSM. (You might even be able to do that beforehand in a location where a fast Internet connection is available.) There should be some settings to control how long JOSM keeps files in its caches. You might want to set a rather long time to not loose these files.</p></li>
<li><p>You might be able to set up a proxy software such as squid ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_(software)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_(software)</a> ) to interrupt queries outside your area of interest. Unfortunately this will require quite a bit of technical knowledge...</p></li>

<p>Thank you for the suggestion. Even in cache, they become slow so what I do now is when I switch to a new area, I click "Flash tile cache" and it makes it a lot faster to load.</p>
