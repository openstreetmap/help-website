<p>Someone asked in January when the problem of almost illegible / invisible green trunk roads on a green background (especially problematic in my country, the Netherlands) will be solved. Answer then: work will start within a couple of months. Any progress yet? Because I know a lot of people who don't like to use OpenStreetMap due to this problem. Maybe trunkroads can be given a more distinguishable color like purple or dark red, or something?</p>
<p>Despite better roadcolors, I don't like to use MapQuest, it has less detailed information and no difference between 4- and 2 lane trunkroads, among other things.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance for any reply!</p>

<p>Can you please refer to the January post? I guess it relates to this ticket? <a href="https://trac.openstreetmap.org/ticket/3038">https://trac.openstreetmap.org/ticket/3038</a></p>
<p>I'm not sure how we can help you about the MapQuest style. What is the intention on your hint?</p>

<p>@ OSM Help: Thanks for your reply! This is the January post i referred to: <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/19312/some-roads-rendered-with-green-colors-which-is-not-readable-on-the-gree-background">https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/19312/some-roads-rendered-with-green-colors-which-is-not-readable-on-the-gree-background</a></p>
<p>@ SomeoneElse: Great tip, thnx! Better colors indeed, though still with same flaws (no distinction between 4 / 2 lane trunkroads).</p>
<p>I see my question has been closed, although earlier questions about the same issue has been answered before. Thanks again anyway!</p>

<p><span></span><span>@Waltar78</span>: please do not feel offended by the close. It is just better discussed elsewhere (e.g. in the ticket iii linked to – you can login with your usual www.osm.org login data). I guess a key thing is: is that change wanted at all? As you already know there is not only that one map which is made of OSM data but <span>ma</span><span>n</span><span>y</span>.</p>
<p>By the way: The (previously mentioned) porting to the <span>different stylesheet language</span> was finished in August 2013.</p>
