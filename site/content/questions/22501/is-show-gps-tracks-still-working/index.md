<p>The "Show GPS Tracks" icon doesn't seem to work any more in Potlatch 1.4. When I click it, it either does nothing or freezes the web page. I used to find this a really useful facility as it allowed manual "track averaging" of several traces along the same footpath.</p>
<p>Is this broken for everyone, in which case when is it likely to be fixed? Or is it just broken for me, in which case does any one have any ideas on what has gone wrong and how I can fix it?</p>

<p>There does indeed seem to be a problem. I suspect that it's gone unnoticed so far because relatively few people are still using Potlatch 1 (I tend to use it alongside Potlatch 2 to view the waypoints in my own traces).</p>
<p>If invoked with a GPS trace (e.g. <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?gpx=1369542&amp;editor=potlatch">http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?gpx=1369542&amp;editor=potlatch</a> ) it displays that OK - it's the fetching of the others that's the problem.</p>
<p>And for the avoidance of doubt Potlatch 2's display of all of the GPS traces in the area (see e.g. <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?gpx=1369542&amp;editor=potlatch2">http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?gpx=1369542&amp;editor=potlatch2</a> ) still works as it always did.</p>
<p>"Potlatch (flash editor)" is still listed in the component dropdown of the <a href="https://trac.openstreetmap.org/">trac</a> "add new ticket" dialog, but I doubt that anyone is actively maintaining it.</p>

<p>Thanks Scai and SomeoneElse for your comments. I have always had potlatch1 set as my default editor, and didn't realise I was running almost obsolete software, but I have now upgraded to potlatch2. It looks as if I may have a bit of a learning curve to deal with, as it looks very different.</p>

<p>I almost always use P2 and I have noticed that the gps traces do not get displayed as fast they used to, maybe because there is so many now. Fortunately my own traces respond ok, but slower than before probably same reason? but it would be nice to hear the opinion of an expert.</p>

<p>Leading on from my comments. If you are only using your own traces then work from the map page, Click on GPS traces, Click see your own traces, Click on edit on the trace. This works instantly for P2 but as the drawback that all the traces are only available after selecting and waiting. I also like to use all available traces to compare with Bing and average a way, because as I'm sure you have found sometimes a trace will have an offset, where as several other traces align with each other which can sometimes be aided where the path is through a gate or over a stile and the other walker must have followed that path even though to trace suggested otherwise.<br />
