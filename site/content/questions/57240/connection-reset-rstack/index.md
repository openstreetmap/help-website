So I'd still say it's a client problem, even if it's not an application problem.

Just looking at the connections to 209.126.122.72, we see the working 3-way handshake, followed by a client Reset after 2 seconds. This would appear to be client timeout.</p><p>There's no evidence whatsoever that there is a network problem to that server - because after the handshake we are waiting for the client to make its request. The client application seems to go away after asking for the TCP connection.</p><p>If a firewall was involved, we perhaps wouldn't expect to see the successful 3-way handshakes. After that there are no client packets to block.</p><p>I notice that the SYN-ACKs have a TTL of 51, meaning that they come from something 13 hops away. Would that be the real server or something else?</p><p>I did notice that the client's SYN for the second connection doesn't support Window Scaling whereas the first and third ones do. I have no idea if this has any relevance.</p><p>Your RDP connection to 151.80.169.249 does contain frequent "out-of-order" or "overtaken" packets (as indicated by the Selective ACKs). Again, there's no evidence that this has any impact on the RDP performance or on the original problem - but may be something else worth investigating.</p></div><div id="comment-57372-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(14 Nov '16, 00:31)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Philst</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-57244" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 8 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 3 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-57244-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
