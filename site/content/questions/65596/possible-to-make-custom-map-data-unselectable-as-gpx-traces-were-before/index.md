<p>I see that in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit,">https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit,</a> "local file" (for uploading GPS tracks) has become "custom map data", and that it can handle more data types. That's cool, but now the track itself on the map is selectable. Before, it was invisible to the mouse. Being selectable has it getting in the way of selecting the road points you're trying to edit... it's become a major slowdown in editing.</p>
<p>Is there perhaps some way to access the old version of the editor, or enable some kind of mode where the custom map data is invisible to the mouse?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>There's an open issue about the data layer interfering with editing:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5257">https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5257</a></p>
<p>I don't think there is a way to lock the data layer, but I expect the problem will be addressed fairly quickly.</p>
