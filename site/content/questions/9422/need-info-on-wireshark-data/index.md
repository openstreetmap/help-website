I am using wireshark to monitor the traffic in the channel through this monitor interface. I have another laptop connected to an AP in the same channel and the laptop is downloading a huge file(say a linux ISO). I get QoS data packets of size greater than 1500. Is it the actual data that is being downloaded? I tried having two devices monitor the same traffic. For a specific SN, I am getting different data on both the machines but of same length. Does this mean that this is not the downloaded data? How do i get the actual data that is part of download? To be more specific, I tried generating tcpdumps and opening them through wireshark, I am getting the same type of data as has been mentioned. Can anyone suggest what I might be missing as part of configuration? I am making sure that the flags fcsfail and control are also set. I am able to monitor LLC protocol data from other machines but this file download. It will be useful for us to know what I am missing as part of configuration.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">ath9k traffic monitor</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>07 Mar '12, 14:01</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2618453e9194929f291128d350b2a4ec?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="srini_wisc&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>srini_wisc<br />
