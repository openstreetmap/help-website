<p>There is a regular golf course, 18 hole or 9 hole where one needs to use a driving club (and even may have a separate driving range for practice), miniature golf where it's all about putting challenges with a putter club, but what about simulated golf?</p>
<p>Even simulated golf seems to have two types: ones that are completely computer driven where there's no "normal" golf ball (and thus small building is sufficient; example: X-Golf), and there are even half computer driven. These types you drive a real ball into netting that's actually several hundred yards away and a computer will compute where your ball went, so you still choose and feel your real club hitting a real ball, but the course and everything else is simulated (example: TopGolf). This type, it almost feels like real golf without the walking. As there is real netting and there is a "real" course for the ball to fly, this can take several acres of land but nowhere near as much as a real golf course.</p>
<p>I suspect these two should get iD templates at some point as they are chain businesses (X-Golf and TopGolf). As far as I know they're probably the only two businesses out there dealing with golf simulations but there's currently inconsistent tagging for these - they're clearly not real golf courses and also definitely not miniature golf in the normal sense...</p>

<li><code>leisure=amusement_arcade</code>? <code>sport=golf</code> may still be appropriate for simulations.</li>
<li>With <code>=minature_golf</code> there's still a small course, so definitely not that. It's like a <code>golf=driving_range</code>, without a proper <code>leisure=golf_course</code>, that's more of a game. I casually searched, and see a few tagged as <code>leisure=sports_centre</code>.</li>

<p>Indeed you can search for "topgolf" in nominatim and people are tagging this chain business all sorts of different ways despite their layout between franchises are pretty much the same - looks like a tall rectangular building whose broad side is facing a driving range. X-Golf franchisees seem to have a bit more flexibility on how they are put together as it's all indoors in a building.</p>
<p>For one thing I will need to fix the one X-Golf that I put in, leisure=golf_course now seems quite wrong for it... For now I'll use arcade/golf...</p>
