This was a slightly tedious effort due to every added display filter increasing the line count in the output of the tshark query, which also changes which line of output the statistics themselves are generated in.</p><p>Anyway my question is this:</p><p>Right now it looks like all outputs of this command will put the statistiics onto a single, very long line even when dozens of display filters are used in the query. Is it a safe assumption with current Wireshark/Tshark versions (in this example, 1.8.6) that the io,stats printout will put all stats on a single very-long line, or will it break the line at some upper limit and use a second line? If it does, what is that upper limit? The reason is I'm making that one-line assumption at the moment and don't want my scripts to break if they're calling a hundred different display filters.</p><p>Related question - any way we could lose the text art in that output and just pump out a nice clean delimited line of stats in the order requested?</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags"><span class="post-tag tag-link-stats" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;stats&#39;">stats</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-tshark" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;tshark&#39;">tshark</span></div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>04 Oct '13, 20:53</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f533c5f20f9c9afbf4b03de08a100e11?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Quadratic&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>Quadratic</span><br />

I'm 'relatively' confident that I'm safe there</p></blockquote><p>You can be safe. I've just checked the source code. There is no limit (besides available RAM), so you can rely on a single line.</p><p>See <code>iostat_draw()</code> in <a href="http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc/trunk-1.10/ui/cli/tap-iostat.c?revision=50712&amp;view=co">tap-iostat.c</a>. The required space for the column data is requested via g_malloc() and the column data itself is printed in small pieces with printf, column by column, so there is not even a large string that needs to be handled internally.</p><p>There is also no limit from the OS, at least I cannot imagine one, because if there was a limit you would not be able to pipe large amounts of data via STDOUT/STDIN into another program, which is obviously not the case on any of the current OSes.</p><p>Regarding the fancy ASCII art. You can simply convert that to CSV with this one liner on Linux and similar OSes.</p><pre><code>   tshark -nr input.pcap  -z io,stat,1 -q | grep &#39;&lt;&gt;&#39; | sed &#39;s/ &lt;&gt; */;/&#39; | sed &#39;s/^| *//&#39; | sed &#39;s/ *| */;/g&#39;</code></pre><p>It might not be the best and fastest, nor the most elegant regexp, but it works ;-)</p><p>Regards<br />
