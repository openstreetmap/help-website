<p>Someone's already restored that node, so if you send OSM OSM data to your GPS in a day or so it'll have that city back in the data again (I'm assuming that the maps for your GPS are updated fairly frequently and based on extracts of OSM data that are updated fairly frequently - depending on which maps you're downloading that might not be the cause).</p>
<p>With regard to what to do about the user that deleted the node, be gentle. It's one of their very first edits, and everyone makes mistakes at the start. Normally in a case like this I'd <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:SomeoneElse/new_mapper_messages">send them a very polite message</a> explaining what's happened, and offer to help with fixing it.</p>
<p>In this case it's about six weeks since they last edited, so they may have moved on, in which case I'd look through their other changes for any that might be problematical and either try and resolve yourself, ask someone else in the local community for help resolving, or ask somewhere like the #OSM <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Irc">IRC</a> channel.</p>
<p>The good news is that the reversion tools in e.g. JOSM are now much better than they once were, so fixing issues of this sort is much easier than it once was.</p>
