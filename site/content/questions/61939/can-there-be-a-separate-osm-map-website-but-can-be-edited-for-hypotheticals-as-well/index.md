<p>I had this thought today while looking at a map of my hometown. I was thinking of all these ways that the local transportation department could build up certain areas, and how I could apply them to OSM. However, it is purely obvious that OpenStreetMap users can apply edits that truly exist (or are in the planning works). Is there a website already out there that keeps the same system of OSM (with the already existing features [roads, lakes, etc.])that allows users to edit hypothetically? If there is not a site dedicated to this, is this only made possible by an arduous task of creating another website for this purpose? Please let me know if any of this is possible.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Your question is nearly the same like <a href="/questions/3643/howto-setup-a-private-osm-for-public-planning-eg-at-charrettes">https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/3643/howto-setup-a-private-osm-for-public-planning-eg-at-charrettes</a> , isn't it?</p>
<p>Maybe the tools like uMap which are suggested at <a href="/questions/27621/personalised-maps">https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/27621/personalised-maps</a> are already feature-rich enough? You can add lines, markers, ... on top of a OSM base map.</p>
