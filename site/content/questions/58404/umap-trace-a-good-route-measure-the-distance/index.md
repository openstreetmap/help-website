<p>Hello, I am new to map drawing, and, as a linux user, I decided to use Umap / OSM. I've started, but I would like to improve what I did. My first route (bicycle journey) was drawn with points, and I wonder how to trace this route with a line following roads in a nicer way. I would like to measure the total route length, from starting point to the end: I did not find how to do that. Can you help me? Thanks Sophie</p>
