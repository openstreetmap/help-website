I set a time reference on frame 16 just to see how long the process takes in regard to the DHCP Discover starting it off:</p><p>16: DHCP Discover</p><p>17: ACK to 16</p><p>18: (suspected) DHCP Offer</p><p>19: DHCP Request</p><p>20: ACK to 19</p><p>and then it gets silent :) what is weird is that I don't see ACKs for many frames from the AP e.g. frame 18 - this pattern is going to repeat</p><p>then 2 seconds later:</p><p>23: DHCP Re-Request &lt;-- fits to why there was no DHCP ACK before</p><p>24: ACK to 23</p><p>25: (sucpected) DHCP ACK</p><p>and again no wireless ACK but also no wireless retransmission, so there is s.th. strange.
