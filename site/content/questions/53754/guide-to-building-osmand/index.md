<p>Obviously I'm new to this. After digging through the internet for some time, I've found no tutorial on how to get started on using osmandroid. The gitHub repository is full of resources however, there is no real guide on steps that can walk me through. I've downloaded the whole github file and I've managed to get some things working from a video I found in Portuguese, but I'm getting compile errors and it's seriously hard to debug. I'm opening this question so that other users like me looking to join the OSM community can have a step by step guide to:</p>
<p>i) Adding ALL of the resources off git hub to their proper folder ii) Adding these resources as a library and/or dependencies iii) Adding any other OSM resources that are available</p>
<p>With the objective of new programmers being able to start programming seamlessly with ALL of the osm resources after the guide is complete.</p>
<p>P.S. Don't waste anyone's time complaining about a newbie guide or question. This will be good for the community and new comers alike.</p>
<p>Thanks (:</p>

<p>The OSM Help site and osmdroid are unrelated. If anyone would be creating a step-by-step guide, it would need to be the creators of the osmdroid software.</p>
<p>There seems to be a lot of documentation on the GitHub site related to using osmdroid. Is none of it useful to you?</p>

<p>I think that you might be misunderstanding something. "OpenStreetMap" is essentially just a big pile of data. Lots of people write software that works with it, and OsmAnd is one of those things - it's designed and built entirely independently of the people who look after the OSM servers and data. Also, the help site here is designed for "questions with answers" like "how do I do X". Your question here essentially boils down to "OsmAnd's build documentation is crap", which isn't really an answerable question.</p>
<p>As suggested below you need to explain what you were trying to do, what instructions you followed, and what didn't work. There's a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osmand">Google Group</a> for OsmAnd - you're more likely to get an answer from someone familiar with the software there.</p>
<p>For my part I've not built a version of OsmAnd for about 3 years - I found it quite straightforward at the time, but 3 years is a lifetime in the Android world and lots of things (including the default Android build environment) have changed since then.</p>
