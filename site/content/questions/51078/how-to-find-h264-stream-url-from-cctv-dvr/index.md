I can view these live streams via the horrible Active X site, or though a few different android apps.</p><p>iSpy will allow you to add your own custom H264 stream, but I can not find how to enter the stream URL correctly. I don't know much about RTSP streams, or if the DVR even outputs it.</p><p>I captured some packets of just one single channel (channel 4) on Wireshark, but I'm not educated enough to understand what I'm looking at. I can see the login info (temp account just in case) in plain text, and I can see what is probably video data shortly after that. How can I take the information I have thus far, and apply that towards finding a video stream URL that I can add to iSpy</p><p>Wireshark File: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B04k9KoKyvzJTk8tbXNUc1JjdmM/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B04k9KoKyvzJTk8tbXNUc1JjdmM/view?usp=sharing</a></p><p>iSpy Screenshot: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B04k9KoKyvzJMWxLN1kyd21sVEk/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B04k9KoKyvzJMWxLN1kyd21sVEk/view?usp=sharing</a></p><p>I'm willing to put in the work to get this working, I just don't know where to start.
