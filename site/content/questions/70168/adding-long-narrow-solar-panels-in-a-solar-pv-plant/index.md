<p>I would really like to always add the details of a photovoltaic solar power plant, showing all of the individual solar panel units, or whatever they call them. But when you have many, many, many very long and narrow units, mapping them as rectangles seems overly tedious, even if you copy and paste. How about mapping them as single-line ways? That would be much easier, and if properly rendered, could be just as good cartographically.</p>
