<p>I came across this road: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/346795168">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/346795168</a> tagged access=official, highway=tertiary, vehicle=no. In the wiki, I can only find "official" mentioned as a value for more specific access tags, such as horse or bicycle.</p>
<p>Reality on the ground is that the road is signed "no motor vehicles except military vehicles and vehicles with a permit", which I would tag something like motor_vehicle=private (or no),foot=yes,bicycle=yes. Would I be making a mistake if I changed tagging to that? Also, does it really make sense to have a tertiary where the general public cannot drive? I'm tempted to downgrade it to "unclassified", perhaps with width= <em>and surface=</em> to indicate that it is a really nice road, you just can't use it. (Actually, there is a bus route running along it, so I suppose the bus company has permission.)</p>

<p>The current thinking would be motor_vehicle=permit (all the other stuff isn't needed) if permits are actually given out and otherwise motor_vehicle=private (or perhaps no depending on the details). Access=official is not something useful in any case.</p>
<p>Further tertiary are supposed to be connections between smaller places that are part of the public road network, this is obviously not the case in your example.</p>

<p>The access=permit tag has been discussed at great length on the Tagging list. The most recent thread is here: <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2018-August/038160.html">https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2018-August/038160.html</a> Despite the seeming simplicity of this tag, many oppose its adoption for various reasons. Your case is quite similar so you might benefit from a quick scan of that thread.</p>

<p>I tagged it as "private"; my educated guess is that permits are <em>not</em> a mere formality but are granted only to those who really need them.</p>
