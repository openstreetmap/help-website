<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I dont know wow to categorize buildings/facilities connected with wine making/storing/consumption/selling.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Especially <strong>wine cellar</strong> where you can drink wine. That's kind of small "wine pub". This is common in central europe, France, Greece. Here is example:</p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Pru%C5%A1%C3%A1nky-Nechory.jpg">cellar1</a></p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Pru%C5%A1%C3%A1nky-Nechory_9.jpg">cellar2</a></p>
<p>There is wine storage in basement and room with table(s) and benches where you can drink and consume</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sklepy-podluzi.cz/userfiles/image/fotky/026b.jpg">consumption room</a></p>
<p>(this room is often on the ground floor). Sometimes it has bedroom/livingroom in second floor, as is on the first photo. This is, among others, part of tourism (tasting different regional wines), but mostly part of cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Here is map pictogram for this type of wine callars (for inspiration):</p>
<p><a href="http://mapy.cz/s/9tCY">wine cellar pictogram</a></p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>Winery</strong> which is facility for wine making and selling in bigger amount, built for profit and bussiness. (unlike wine cellars above)</p>
<p><strong>3) Winehouse</strong> built only for wine consumption, stylish and restaurant-type interior</p>
<p><em>Wine glass</em> could be used for pictogram of 2) or 3) cathegory.</p>
<p><strong>4) wine shop</strong> Where you can primarily buy bottled or barreled wine and taste it before you buy (this is widespread in bigger cities in my country). This should be in "<em>shop</em>" cathegory.</p>

<li>I've been in something like you describe so I know what you're talking about, but I can't find any existing tags that would fit. You might just have to make up your own or do a bunch of <a href="http://taginfo.osm.org/">Taginfo</a> searching. Maybe something along the lines of <del>attraction</del> tourism=wine_cellar?</li>
<li>There's a proposal for the tag <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/Winery">man_made=winery</a> and it's being used 243 times</li>
<li>This sounds like you could use amenity=restaurant with cuisine=wine (already used 31 times)</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:shop%3Dwine">shop=wine</a> is documented and being used</li>

<p>Well, my idea was to make OSM more comfortable and synoptic for wine-lovers. Sothat some new icon(s) will be necessary (see "wine cellar pictogram" http link in my question). Question for further debate is: which, for what kind of wine facility and how many new icons.</p>

<p><span>@GISator</span> There are two parts to this question - "what should I tag these facilities as" and "how should they be represented on a map"?</p>
<p>These are separate questions. In order to help answer the first, follow the "taginfo" link from <span>@alester</span>'s answer you'll be able to search for wine-related tags that people have used in the past. In order to answer the second, you'll need to lobby the maintainers of whatever map style you want these features to appear on (or make your own). There are 5 different map styles on osm.org, and hundreds if not thousands elsewhere.</p>
