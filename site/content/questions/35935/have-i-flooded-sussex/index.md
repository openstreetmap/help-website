<p>I added an area tagged with natural=water earlier to show the outline of our local river. I was working in JOSM, everything validated when I uploaded and then rendered fine when I checked a few minutes later.</p>
<p>I then added an abandoned farm nearby and now the whole area is rendered as if under water!</p>
<p>I've deleted the natual=water I'd added (and the abandoned farm for good measure) but eveywhere is still blue. Only visible when zoomed in to 13 or more.</p>
<p>I'll happily add more detail but I can't think what is relevant. I'm not even sure it's something I've done but I can't see that anyone else has been working on the area and I don't know where to start trying to fix it other than what I've already done.</p>
<p>You can see the area <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/50.8650/0.1269">here</a></p>
<p>I was working on the stretch of Glynde Reach that runs from the village of Glynde, to the west, until it reaches a dam just to the west of the A27 road.</p>

<p>There was a wider problem with the UK being flooded last night and I doubt it was your fault - it seems more likely to have been an issue with the coastline in Scotland. Regardless, it's fixed now.</p>

<p>Hi, you certainly did cause a flood. Don't worry though your deletion has resolved the problem, it will take a little while for the area to be re-rendered at all zoom levels. I would suspect that your riverbank area/areas were not closed hence the flooding.</p>

<p>I'm 99% certain the riverbank area was closed as it rendered properly for a while and deleting it didn't seem to help. I've accepted Richard's answer because it absolves me of responsibility!</p>

<p>Non-closed riverbanks just dont render: they never, ever cause flooding. <span>@BCNorwich</span> is just wrong here. Flooding is a problem with the coastline not other water features. This is because coastlines are so long that it is not practicable to treat them as regular polygons, and therefore are a particular special case..</p>
