Browsers work fine, and my internal network also seems to work fine. But pretty much everything I download from the web comes in as corrupt. IE eihter complains that the file is corrupt, Mozilla stops the download after a few seconds and tells me that the download was interrupted, When I do get a file, the checksum is wrong, larger files (videos) cannot be run, etc. This happens on at least 3 computers connected to my network (All Windows, one Win7, one Win8, one WinServer 2011). To get to the bottom of this, I ran Wireshark for some downloads, and the logs do show some issues, but I don't know where to go from here.</p><p>The log shows the computer happily running along with lines that I think show the progress. Then suddenly black lines appear: "TCP Dup" and "TCP previous segment not captured"(how can I post the lines here?)</p><p>So something is going wrong. How do I further analyze that and, more importantly, fix that?</p><p>Thanks.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">downloads corrupted</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>11 Feb '16, 16:19</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2a6d8feeba784a7ae046658a3efe82ed?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="mb_1&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>mb_1<br />
