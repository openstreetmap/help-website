When I am transmitting a stream of shoutcast music to the net to a public server I seen to get a loop of my various musics mixing back into my stream, I have only tested on internal LAN for some time now.</p><p>Anyway I did a few things and had a 60 second ghost stream loop then removed some programs and got rid of the problem but then installed a certain music player updated of course and now have a 4 min 4 sec music loop on my public radio station when I connect to the web page even if the shoutcast servers are shutdown.</p><p>I have also had an IP conflict on my OpenVPN server with a certain music player installed on a reboot. I have since removed the certain music player IP conflict gone but music loop remains.</p><p>Ask me to explain something if you dont understand my english please.</p><p>I don't really expect an answer.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">ghost pcacket</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>02 Aug '13, 22:19</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fda026b086bb4cc04d5b0f407b40d3dd?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Mp3streetparty&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Mp3streetparty<br />
