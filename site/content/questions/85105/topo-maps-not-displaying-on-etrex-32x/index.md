<p>Just to clarify - what "topo data" are you asking about? Is it an OSM-based map, and if so, where did you get it from?</p>

<p>It sounds like you need to have a conversation with Garmin, or the shop that you bought it from. People here will be able to help with OSM-based maps, but probably not with the ones that came from Garmin.</p>

<p>Thanks for suggestions but neither Ordnance Survey (from whom the unit was purchased) nor Garmin could help. Garmin's answer to everything is to reset the unit which really does absolutely nothing except waste time. So now I am stuck with a 3 month old useless piece of electronic Garmin junk. I wish someone else made a decent GPS as the previous unit we had (GPSMAP64S) had serious problems, well known as well across the internet, which Garmin won't fix.</p>
<p>But thanks anyway.</p>

<p>There's a whole bunch of legislation in the UK (including, but not limited to, <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/54">this</a>) that determines what rights you have as a consumer. From what you're saying, it seems that you might need to remind them of their legal responsibilities.</p>
<p>That's not really anything to do with OSM though - what might be (and is probably best asked in a separate question) is "how do I get OSM-based maps on my Garmin eTrex 32x (or GPSMAP 64S)". I use eTrex and GPSMAP devices with OSM-based maps all the time.</p>

<p>If Garmin and the dealer won't or can't help. I would try a OSM on Garmin download.

<p>After receiving no useful help from either O.S. or Garmin we set about investigating the problem ourselves. A friend has an etrex 30x so we took the SD card from that and put in the 32x and all worked. Read all the maps, perfect! So I reformatted my SD card and made a copy from my friends card, put that into the 32x and again it worked.</p>
<p>How simple was that and why didn't Garmin think that perhaps the SD card was somehow corrupted and/or unreadable?</p>
<p>All Garmin kept telling me to do was to reset the device - why?? Once would have been enough.</p>
<p>So all is well and I thank those who answered my plea for help.</p>

<p>Maybe the "demo" was time limited and it was disabled by the update. Garmin may have wanted you to buy a new map. Very pleased have a working map now.</p>
