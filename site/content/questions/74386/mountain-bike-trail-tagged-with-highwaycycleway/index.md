<p>Hi, I just signed up on OSM because my GPS app uses OSM and a hiking trail was not showing up that I know about. I queried the trail and it was tagged with highway=cycleway. This trail is multi-use mountain biking and hiking trail but no horses allowed. It is located in a wilderness area near Mount Charleston, Nevada and is a basic dirt track with patches of boulders, gravel, and is no more than 3 or 4 ft wide. It is found on mountain biking apps such as Trail Forks. The name of the trail is Showgirl. What tags should this trail have and how do I go about correcting the existing tags?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><code>highway=cycleway</code> on its own is a misleading tag, as people will see this and expect that they can ride it with a normal city, touring or road bike. Cycling route-planners will parse this tag as a way that they can safely route bikes along it.</p>
<p><code>highway=path</code> on its own is always a bad tag because it gives no hints as to the construction, purpose and quality of the trail.</p>
<p>So the trick here will be to add several tags to better illustrate the nature of the trail. At a minimum I'd suggest you include <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:surface"><code>surface</code></a>= and <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:mtb:scale"><code>mtb:scale</code></a>=.</p>

<p>As said in the comment there is ongoing discussion on the best way of tagging mountain biking trails.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dcycleway">highway=cycleway</a> is not too bad if your trail is mostly for bikes, even if it's usually more for long distance (flat?) cycling.</p>
<p>Your trail might be better with an <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dpath">highway=path</a>, and relevant <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:access#Transport_mode_restrictions">access tags</a>, if it's equally for hiking and biking.</p>
<p>One should note that foot access on cycleways is not deterministic. In USA it should be allowed by <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_tags_for_routing/Access_restrictions#United_States_of_America">default</a>, but it's probably safer to add a foot=yes tag, if you keep the cycleway tag.</p>
<p>There might be a problem with your GPS app in this, as it should display cycleways IMHO.</p>

<p>I took a brief look at the area and saw that a good portion of the Showgirl Trail is tagged as highway=path. The rendering of a "path" is dependent on who is making the map and for what purpose the map is intended.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, your cycling application doesn't render a path as a highway that's usable by bicycles so paths might not appear on it at all. You should not take that as a justification to simply change that portion of the Showgirl Trail to a cycleway without checking it in person, however.</p>

<p>Well I'd say <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/357833940">half</a> is tagged path, and the other <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/357834012">half</a> cycleway. I think (never been there myself) that both should be tagged the same. Either path, with bicycle=yes|designated, or cycleway with foot=yes. surface=dirt and mtb_scale= would be great also I guess.</p>
<p>Oh and I'm pretty sure that the bottom of the trail should be connected to the road !</p>
<p>And while looking around, <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/150946283">Desert View Point</a> doesn't look like a hamlet to me and the road at <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/301034986">Angel Peak</a> seems all wrong and there are even highway=road at the end of the road !</p>
<p>Lot of little things to do in this area if you want to start mapping and know this place <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/18276/jerry-maoli">@Jerry Maoli</a>. Think about contacting previous mappers to ask about their choices.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>
