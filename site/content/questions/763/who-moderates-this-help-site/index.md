<p>The FAQ says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who moderates this community?<br />
The short answer is: you. This website is moderated by the users. The karma system allows users to earn rights to perform a variety of moderation tasks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why it is not said that the questions/answered can be moderated by people who are also answering the questions ? This is questioning the neutrality of this help tool. Anyone that have a karma &gt; 400 can edit all answers and then bring them around to personnal opinions.<br />

<p>On the StreetView page, Andy had used the comment function to make an addition to an answer I had posted. Because we're striving to create good, all-encompassing answers and not a mess of different answers with lots of comments each, I have taken Andy's comment, built it into the text of my answer, and then removed it. That was a friendly action that had nothing to do with counter arguments.</p>
<p>Apart from that, <a href="http://help.openstreetmap.org">help.openstreetmap.org</a> is not a discussion forum or general platform for the free expression of opinion, but a Q&amp;A site geared mainly towards new users. If you are unhappy with the answers provided you can vote them down and/or write your own. If the community is unhappy with your answer then they can again vote that down. If you then go on to basically repeat your own, down-voted answer in comments to other answers, that doesn't help anyone, and such comments are liable to be deleted.</p>
<p>Comments with counter arguments are not generally forbidden. They are just useless if they only repeat what has already been written in another answer. Also, comments or answers that reflect a minority opinion should, in my opinion, be removed because, as I said, this is not a discussion forum but an attempt at finding one, or a couple, of good answers to a given question.</p>
<p>You must accept that your opinion on using Google Street View for expanding our maps is a minority opinion, as is very well reflected on that question page. If you want to discuss it, the mailing lists are the right place for that.</p>
