<p>I am having the same issue. Running Chrome 58.0.3029.110 in Win7</p>
<p>These are the first changes I have tried saving on this laptop (I've retired the one I was previously using). Significantly, I was using iD 2.2.0 on my previous machine - I see that 2.2.1 is currently loaded on my current one.</p>
<p>If I back my save attempt out (I use "Show My Location" to do that, since there's no "Cancel" button now either), the changeset comment still floats in the side frame and doesn't go away.</p>

<p>Well... I'm not sure why, but I lost my changes after my 4th browser restart. Obviously not happy about that... but the issues with saving are not presenting anymore. No more problems with rendering on the editable map either.<br />
Feh. 2.2.0 was beautifully smooth - I'm hoping this is a very isolated issue in 2.2.1.</p>

<p>There is a recent? change of a changeset having a maximum capacity (currently 10,000 edits). Could yours be bigger and iD not able to manage it?<br />
Josm handles a bigger changeset by splitting into smaller pieces on upload.<br />

<p>I had this happen a second time to me a couple of days ago. It appears that this is the sequence to trigger the bug:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make changes with iD editor</li>
<li>Close the browser window without saving</li>
<li>iD gets updated to a newer version while you're away</li>
<li>Come back later and choose to restore your unsaved edits</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, save will not work. You must close the browser window, reopen, and choose not to restore. Then Save will work again.</p>

<p>Perhaps it's just a rendering problem. Try making the text size smaller (place the mouse pointer over the light panel on the left, hold <code>Ctrl</code>, and scroll down with the mousewheel). Try pressing <code>Enter</code> or <code>Ctrl+Enter</code> after entering a changeset comment.</p>

<p>I also have tried pressing tab to cycle through selecting elements in my browser, pressing space at any invisible element to invoke it. I did not find a save button this way.</p>
<p>Each time I open my browser and go to OSM, it prompts me that I have unsaved edits, and I choose to "restore". This does restore my edits each time. I have not tried discarding my edits, but as you can see, I have a large number of edits that I would prefer not to lose.</p>
<p>I also have tried making a change after restoring, so as to "touch" the data in case it is not marked as being changed. This does not bring back the save button either.</p>
<p>I have had Adblock Plus running all along, and the save button worked fine with it before. I tried turning off Adblock Plus with no effect. Save button still gone.</p>
<p>I rebooted the computer, no difference.</p>

<p>I ended up discarding my changes, and now it works fine. I was able to make changes and successfully save them.</p>

<p>This happened to me again - laptop rebooted overnight before I had saved a bunch of changes.<br />
I know, mea culpa. But I found a fix/workaround!<br />
ROOT CAUSE: iD had updated to 2.2.2, and although most of my changes came back, only the changeset comment dialogue box was available upon trying to save - no save button - and the dialogue box would not go away and rendered the left frame unusable. So I can definitively say that the restoration of unsaved changes from a previous iD version is the issue. In other words, you can't save changes from iD 2.2.1 in a browser session using iD 2.2.2.</p>
<p>FIX: Control-Z (or use the Undo button) for ALL of the changes that are cached in your session, until the Undo button is no longer lit. Then, CTRL-Y (or Redo) all of the changes over again. You may have to mash that button for quite a while... This will redo all of your edits in the current version of iD, and saving will be re-enabled.<br />
Sooooo glad this workaround actually worked - and I've learned a valuable lesson that I should have learned the first time. &lt;<em>redfaced</em>&gt;</p>
<p>(Simon - I've posted here instead of to iD development since this question is still here, and in my opinion is now resolved)</p>
