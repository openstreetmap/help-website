<p>What is the best way to tag a boardwalk?</p>
<p>I am looking at the tags for the Wildwood boardwalk and it is labeled as a service road. This is incorrect as there are no cars allowed on the boardwalk. It is a pedestrian boardwalk that serves as a major tourist attraction. There are games, shops, and restaurants on the boardwalk. Plus, there are piers that have rides and more games connected to the boardwalk itself. The service road distinction is totally wrong, but I am not sure what to replace it with. Would love to get others thoughts as I am still pretty new to all this.</p>

<p>I'm guessing you're asking about <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/307751073">http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/307751073</a> which is actually tagged as a "highway=pedestrian"? If so, that sounds pretty much correct based on your description.</p>

<p>Okay cool, that seems correct. But then should I get rid of the service road tag? There is this tramcar, but it is basically a train of golf carts. The service road distinction seems superfluous to me since no cars are allowed on the board walk.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/339/edloach">@EdLoach</a> good spot. I'd have thought it was more deserving of a route relation rather than a way, personally. The people on the tagging list may have more thoughts too: <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/tagging">https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/tagging</a> .</p>
