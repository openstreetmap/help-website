<p>There are many reasons why you should not tag dogs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dogs aren't a permanent feature. You probably don't know if this dog is always there or it was just that one time.</li>
<li>Dogs don't live forever. So the next time you visit the same place then there might be small, cute and very visitor-friendly dog.</li>
<li>You would either need to mark all roads near that farm with warning tags, or use a node with a warning and a radius tag on farm to mark the hazard. First possibility is troublesome and gives afterwards no information about the exact origin of hazard. Second possibility is probably troublesome for the software to use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably the best thing to do is to inform local police about the dog (if it doesn't help than I would prefer the hazard=dog tag).</p>

<p>There are just to many of such dog owners in these parts to go and inform the police about them. The farmers who keep them will not switch to cute and small ones the next time you visit (and I visited all of them more than once).</p>
<p>The dogs I'm talking about are more or less permanent feature (well, no less permanent than, say, a shop that opens one year and closes down the next).</p>
