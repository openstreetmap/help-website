<p>As I've already said, read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask</a> . One of the suggestions in there is "Help others reproduce the problem". How exactly can people do this with the level of information that you have provided so far?</p>
<p>Another problem is that (at first glance) it doesn't seem to be related to OpenStreetMap at all, just about how react native apps work on a mobile device, the OS of which you're keeping secret from us.</p>
<p>EDIT: Apparently it's Android.</p>

<p>Have you tried reading some of the answers at <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=stackoverflow+background+location+android&amp;t=ffsb&amp;ia=web">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=stackoverflow+background+location+android&amp;t=ffsb&amp;ia=web</a> ? There are a number of questions, some of which are partial duplicates of each other, and some of which touch on issues specific to later Android OS versions.</p>
<p>However, first I'd suggest taking a step back and thinking about how you are obtaining locations (from GPS? from Google? from some other provider?) and asking what's best for your application, for example - does it need to work with or work without Google Play Services? That'll allow you to cut down the stackoverflow answers into a list that applies to your situation, and go forward from there.</p>
