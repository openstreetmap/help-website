"make install" puts the actual Wireshark binary in the installed directory (no more shell-script wrapper).</p><p>On the 2nd machine (with the copy of the install) do you have an environment variable WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY set? That should only be set when Wireshark is running from the build directory.</p><p>BTW, why not build an RPM ("make rpm-package") and install that on the 2nd machine?</p></div><div id="comment-49973-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(08 Feb '16, 08:33)</span> JeffMorriss ♦</div></div><span id="49974"></span><div id="comment-49974" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-49974-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Ok, how check the WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY flag in 2nd machine? printenv not showing that flag itself...</p><p>Currently i am running ./autogen.sh, ./configur,make, make install to get the binary in build machine.Could you please share the process of make rpm-package?</p></div><div id="comment-49974-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(08 Feb '16, 09:09)</span> Abhisek</div></div><span id="49977"></span><div id="comment-49977" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-49977-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>If printenv doesn't show it then it's not set.

As mentioned earlier most people don't NEED to change wireshark.spec.in . But if your options aren't taken into account by the configure/spec logic then you'd simply have to change the configure options in <code>packaging/rpm/SPECS/wireshark.spec.in</code>, re-run ./configure, and then build the RPM.</p></div><div id="comment-50270-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(17 Feb '16, 07:36)</span> JeffMorriss ♦</div></div><span id="50718"></span><div id="comment-50718" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-50718-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks All!!! The Actual RootCause: the binary is compiled with root permission, and the configure option is like <code>./configure --prefix=&lt;path to store binary&gt; --with-gtk2=yes --disable-glibtest</code></p><p>Now in other machine, the compiled binary is also run with root permission. so it will set prefix to <code>&lt;path to store binary&gt;</code> in second machine also. The Authors is having path set relative to prefix which is the path of first machine, so unable to get the path.</p><p>Work Around: <code>wsutil/filesystem.c</code> is having the set path functions, so every decision making case uncheck root user, so it will set prefix from environment variable.</p></div><div id="comment-50718-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(04 Mar '16, 06:20)</span> Abhisek</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-49962" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 12 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 7 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-49962-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
