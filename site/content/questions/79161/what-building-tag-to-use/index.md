<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm currently confused by tags like building=detached building=semidetached_house building=apartments. So surely a "detached" house can the an apartments building. But I guess I should tag it as "appartments" ? (not "detached") A house can share one wall with another one - but does this define a "semidetached_house" - or only what I would term a "Doppelhaushälfte" in German; this is what I assume.</p>
<p>More generally: At least on first look, the tags seem to specify different "dimensions" of a house. But it seems that this is not the case. There more seems to be a sort of hierarchy and I should use the first tag matching. (e.g. probably 'apartments' before 'detached')</p>
<p>Is there some generic discussion of that ? I searched but so far missed.</p>
<p>And yes, this is the reason I asked <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/79157/how-can-i-find-my-changes-with-a-specific-comment">How can I find my changes with a specific comment ?</a></p>
<p>I need to recheck what I did - as soon as I understood, how to do it correctly.... I've checked <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/building#values">DE:Gebäude</a> but I'm still wondering....</p>

<p>The main guide to the <code>building=*</code> tag is <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building">here</a> (<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Key:building">DE version</a>).</p>
<p>The house tags are all for single family homes that are mostly independent. At most they will share a couple of walls with a neighbour, but otherwise are separate dwellings.</p>
<p>Apartment buildings are buildings that can be divided up in a variety of ways and the individual homes are more tied into a unified structure with a much greater degree of integration and shared services. Apartment building usually have shared hallways/passageways to access the individual flats etc, but this isn't always the case.</p>
<p>These lines can get quite blurry as developers have come up with many weird and wacky variations over the years. If you don't think you could draw lines on a top view and cleanly divide the building into individual addresses, then it's probably an apartment building for OSM purposes.</p>
