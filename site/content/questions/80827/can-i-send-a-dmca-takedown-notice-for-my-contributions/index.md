<p>There are some Iranian map apps that do not comply the terms of ODbL (they remix the map but don't share data with ODbL license) but OSMF doesn't have lawyer resources to sue them. I tried to send a request to remove them from google play using <a href="https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905?hl=en">this form</a> but it requires to be the copyright owner or act as they behalf. I'm not OSMF so I didn't send the request.</p>
<p>Since I am the copyright owner of my contribution, can I send that request for just my contributions? So if they don't remove my edits in their map, they should comply the ODbL or be removed from google play. Will I succeed if I send such a request?</p>

<p>I'm sure you could. Although I'm not sure how much attention Iranian firms are going to take of a very US-centred piece of legislation. DCMA works best when entities are anxious to avoid the cost of a lawsuit.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, I would not advise that course of action. Highly adversarial approaches may not benefit OSM and our contributions in the longer term. I think that finding an effective strategy to resolve such issues is complex &amp; highly nuanced. It is therefore better not to 'burn your boats' at this stage.</p>
<p>I've been following some of the twitter threads on this topic, and was already aware of the degree of frustration about this in the Iranian community, but other than the advice above, I'm afraid I can't suggest an alternative set of actions.</p>
