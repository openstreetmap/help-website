<p>I am able to load self-created aerial Imagery (WMS or TMS) on JOSM for editing with mapwarper.net, How can I load this imagery to mapnik o how to see it on my nominatim webpage?</p>
<p>Edit: I'm using a virtualBox with ubuntu 14.04 Lts over windows 7 professional. I installed my tile server following <a href="http://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/building-a-tile-server-from-packages/">http://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/building-a-tile-server-from-packages/</a> and I browsed to localhost/osm/slippy.html and I saw my imported country map just fine.</p>
<p>At this point I was needing a way to search for address or a place I have added to my local osm data, so I decide to install Nominatin and after several hours trying to compile it, I could compile the source Nominatin-2.2.0, the other source I found in many tutorials won compile fauling the ./autoconfig command. Later after hours of trial and error I could change the niminatim tile.js to point to my recent installed tile server (could not find an explained instructions to do that). After I get Nominating working I could browse to localhost/nominatim (nominatim webpage) and see my tiles and I could make searches to my local data for address and places.</p>
<p>At this point I need a way to edit the map of my server so I decided to install the RailsPort. I did it but nither in these help or in google I could find how to point the RailsPort to my server so the maps I see when I browse localhost:3000 is the data from openstreetmap.org (if you have any instructions for these please send them). As I failed to use the RailsPort I decided to use offline editing with JOSM, so I downloaded my area of interest, show the imagery and edit the map, reimported the osm data to my local server, the same to Nominatim and whe browse to localhost/nominatim I could see my edits.</p>
<p>Finally I need to see imagery (I will take aerial photos) in my localhost/nominatim togheter with mapnik tiles.</p>
<p>If there is a better way to do what I want to do, please tell me.</p>

<p>Please EDIT your question and tell us in detail:</p>
<p>What framework do you use to display map tiles rendered by mapnik? OpenLayers, Leaflet or something else?</p>
<p>What is exactly "your nominatim webpage"?</p>
