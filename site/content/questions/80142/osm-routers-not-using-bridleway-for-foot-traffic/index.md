<p>There have been no mapping changes to the bridleway since 2016.</p>

<p>It's pretty easy to come up with "router fails" with the routers on osm.org, to be honest. <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=fossgis_osrm_foot&amp;route=53.99220%2C-0.91070%3B53.99260%2C-0.91030#map=13/53.9992/-0.8805">This</a> is one that I came up with a while ago.</p>
<p>To be fair to the routers on osm.org, they're basically there to show that you can use OSM data for routing rather than give you a perfect route in every place in the world. They're not trying to make sure that they follow the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_tags_for_routing/Access_restrictions#Default">different routing rules for each country</a> - and those routing rules aren't hard and fast, as the asterisks in some of the tables make clear.</p>

<p>About your "fail", I guess they didn't imagine sidewalks on trunk road ! Sounds scary. Or maybe they don't take sidewalk into account at all (yet)... In that case, I understand blacklisting trunk roads for foot routing. But yeah, 15km detour seems harsh... ;-)</p>

<p>Actually the text of the wiki page shows that England legally has foot=yes and Germany doesn't.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_tags_for_routing/Access_restrictions">defaults</a> page (which routers might use) says that bridleways are only for horses internationaly. I'm not sure the country level defaults are used by any router. You might want to test in various countries.</p>
<p>So the infobox "Implies... " is misleading and should probably be changed to "Useful combinations".</p>
<p>And you should probably add foot=yes to the shown bridleway if you're sure it's allowed.</p>

<p>I think they will route successfully if tagged foot=yes. I have added foot=yes and bicycle=yes to the bridleway. It should route soon, maybe a day. I often use an online app ( which i don't want name, it also displays copyrighted maps that have usage limits) to create gpxes and it seems to work if the above tags are present. Other will disagree. UPDATE I am fairly sure this Bridleway can be used by walkers. If I lived close by I should survey it and note local signage before tagging it. The routeing with OSRM now does as expected. see pic</p>

<p>We don't actually know the legal status of this bridleway (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/42328362">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/42328362</a> just has "highway=bridleway", there's no "designation" tag). Generally speaking adding "foot=yes" to fix a router bug is a bad idea, since it downgrades the value of where people know that "foot-yes" is actually correct based on actual survey or knowledge of the legal status (e.g. if a local authority's public footpath data has been made available to OSM under a suitable licence).</p>
<p>In this case it's <em>probably</em> a public bridleway and so this tag is <em>quite possibly</em> correct, but it really needs more information. Perhaps you could investigate whether there is licence-compatible data from the local authority that OSM could use to tag it properly as a "public_bridleway"? There's nothing at <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Local_councils_in_the_United_Kingdom">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Local_councils_in_the_United_Kingdom</a> unfortunately.</p>

<p>For completeness, "highway=bridleway" in England and Wales just means "designed for use by horses" (as it does elsewhere in the world) not necessarily "designation=public_bridleway" (which is what a "public bridleway" sign would imply). Permissive bridleways are pretty common - <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/39589904/history">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/39589904/history</a> is one I found a couple of weeks ago. That example of mine is designed for use by horses, and horses are currently allowed to use it, but that's only by permission of the landowner and that permission can be withdrawn at any time.</p>

<p>Not all ways "designed for use by horses" are in England/Wales legal terms "public rights of way". If you see a sign at the end saying "Public Bridleway" then it is, but many others (like the example I linked to earlier) don't have that legal status.</p>
<p>Hopefully your OSM note "is this a footpath and cycleway what do the signs say? please" will get people to report what signage there is, but the OSM terms highway=footway, highway=cycleway and highway=bridleway don't correspond one to one with English/Welsh legal statuses. It's quite common for a cycleway to have the legal status "Public Footpath", for example: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/485751846">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/485751846</a> .</p>

<p>"maybe "harg" can confirm the legal status"</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although Waltham Forest has the statutory duty to maintain the definitive Rights of Way information for the area, there's no statutory duty to make it available online and Waltham Forest does not do this. And so far the only place where I can find it described as a bridleway is on OSM.</p>
<p>What I can say is:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's part of Epping Forest</li>
<li>At <a href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/epping-forest/activities-in-epping-forest/horse-riding-in-epping-forest">https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/epping-forest/activities-in-epping-forest/horse-riding-in-epping-forest</a> is the statement: "The Forest is a great place for a ride with your horse. You can ride on any of the 284km of shared use paths that run through the Forest.</li>
<li>The map linked from that page shows the entire area as green, keyed as "Forest land with unlimited access for walking. "</li>
<li>That particular path is shown on it as a dotted line, but the map doesn't provide a key to indicate what it means</li>
</ul>
<p>So it seems it's definitely available to the public for walking (horse riding requires a licence) but may or may not be a statutory bridleway</p>
