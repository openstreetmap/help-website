Then nothing for quite a while. Then a <strong>new</strong> connection attempt, however with the <strong>same</strong> source port (plus the SYN is either not shown or not in the capture file), and this time with a different SEQ number. That's why Wireshark (which is using relative SEQ numbers by default) is showing such a large SEQ for the SYN-ACK. It believes that this belongs to the old/first connection (same 5-Tupel).</p><p>Anyway, it would be easier to do any analysis with a capture file. Would it be possible to upload the file somewhere (dropbox) and post the link here?</p><p>Regards<br />

Wireshark protocol dissection and analysis are useful tools assisting you but you must not blindly believe them.</p><p>In this particular case (tcp analysis), it is your choice whether to treat the seq/ack numbers as relative ones or absolute ones (relative is a default setting because for most cases it is more convenient for reading); even if set to absolute, the result would be the same.</p><blockquote><p>the new sequence number is larger than expected</p></blockquote><p>In fact, it is higher if taken as relative and assuming a rollover; if taken as absolute, it is lower, so again the "retransmission" conclusion is correct.</p><p>Even the occurrence of RST packet does not change anything about it because even if everything behaves normally, a retransmission may arrive after RST has been seen in the opposite direction, as Wireshark does not take into account at what interface the capture has been taken.</p></div><div id="comment-47805-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(20 Nov '15, 10:53)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="47806"></span><div id="comment-47806" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-47806-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>assuming that Kurt is in the train with no signal, I</p></blockquote><p>not this time :-).

Assume that the NAT device uses 1:1 port forwarding and does not act as a firewall, and that someone at the other side of the globe uses the public IP address of the NAT device to send its tcp requests to the 199.67.137.5. The responses from that server are then routed properly to the NAT device.</p><p>Only a capture on the public interface of the NAT device can say whether the extreme case is true or whether the NAT device went really mad.</p><p>Note that the responses from 443 come towards low port numbers on our side which should explain why the 192.168.0.200 responds with a tcp packet instead of sending icmp port unreachable. Initiating tcp sessions towards port 443 from ports IANA-assigned to distinct services is not a typical behaviour of a web browser so I'd rather suspect something evil.</p></div><div id="comment-47809-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(20 Nov '15, 11:25)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="47823"></span><div id="comment-47823" class="comment"><div id="post-47823-score" class="comment-score">2</div><div class="comment-text"><p>I believe we are chasing a ghost here.
