This is normal for IE browsers. The Encrypted Alert is telling that SSL is closing it's connection, and IE follows up by tearing down the TCP connections with RSTs. Is this trace when the timeout is happening? I don't think you'll be able to debug this because it's encrypted. You're going to have to use HTTP Analyzer or equivalent to figure out what the server is sending you. SSL timeout, and other things can come into play, but you'll need to debug at the http layer.</p></div><div id="comment-15096-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(18 Oct '12, 18:06)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">hansangb</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-15095" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-15095-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
