<p>Actually - one question - what's your OSM username? I've asked the previous editor of the relation to get in touch with you if it was a deliberate deletion* so that you can discuss together. That's just in case - I suspect that the removal of members was neither malicious nor deliberate.</p>

<p>My OSM username is KK-O. I do not understand the answer and the comment totally, but I see, the members of the relation are now available. Could it be possssible, that the deletion causes by the system, because that relation has many members and also many versions?</p>

<p>I'm guessing that the upload of the relation data (from JOSM) failed. Other relations in the same changeset were modified but not deleted.</p>
<p>The relation does look like a bit of a monster and it might be better to split it into several smaller ones, but that's really a question for the local forum / mailing list rather than here.</p>

<p>I've just hit the button to restore the previous version.</p>
<p>It's now coming out of the API OK but the map browser is still timing out retrieving it (maybe because of today's scheduled maintenance)? I've dropped a courtesy email to the previous editor to say that if it was deleted deliberately to have a chat with you.</p>
