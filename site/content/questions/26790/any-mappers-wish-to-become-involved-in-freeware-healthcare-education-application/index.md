<p>Hello there</p>
<p>I am hoping that someone who has some experience in effectively utilizing this amazing resource (as well as possibly some experience with geocoded mapping) might possibly be prepared to become voluntarily involved in our freeware healthcare education application (in the form of a pc simulation game).</p>
<p>Our geographic area of interest is the greater metropolitan Cape Town area. If anyone would be prepared to help, please contact me at jeremy_debeer at yahoo.com.</p>
<p>Edit:<strong>strong text</strong></p>
<p>I have been most fortunate in obtaining a fairly detailed geocoded map of the area (courtesy of a University of Stellenbosch academic) depicting 320 suburbs (which is key to our healthcare system simulation model as depicted on our abstracted Schematic World Map). I have also painstakingly pasted together a couple of composite png images depicting the corresponding area of interest within the OSM.</p>
<p>[A series of Dropbox links to these files are listed below].</p>
<p>I am hoping that someone might possibly be prepared to assist us in creating a dynamic loading map onto which a series of iconic links to our proposed healthcare structures can be positioned (please refer to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5xdzs8hqggpq0jn/OpenStreetMap3.png">https://www.dropbox.com/s/5xdzs8hqggpq0jn/OpenStreetMap3.png</a> for further relevant information). The optimal format of such a map is open to debate - whether it is the default OSM (which tends to obscure the individual icons), a somewhat less cluttered version (that will further highlight the individual icons) or a rendered 3d image (which could appear stunning) ....</p>
<p>Please note that the final (massive) image of the greater metropolitan Cape Town area extends somewhat beyond the initial geocoded map as we are potentially interested in adding some rural districts to the suburban healthcare regions.</p>

<p>We are hoping that someone will be able and willing to create a suitably detailed (and visually aesthetic) scenario map to complement our evolving Schematic World Map.</p>
<p>With kindest regards</p>

<p>Hello you both,</p>
<p>first, this is mora an FAQ site rather than a platform to find volunteers. A better place would have been the OSM mailing lists or the OSM forum.</p>
<p>see <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contact">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contact</a> for other channels.</p>
<p>secondly I edited your email address ... it can be crawled by spam bots!</p>
<p>thirdly: Please edit your question (or write in forum or similar) and tell us how you think to use OSM in your project.</p>
