<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>At the company where I work, after a year of having a tile server running Mapnik with excellent results, we want to add geocoding and routing services. For this purpose, we have <strong>two</strong> servers available.</p>
<p>I was trying to find if it was possible to use the same database for Mapnik and Nominatim but apparently that's not the path to follow even though it <a href="http://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/dev/2011-April/022312.html">might be a way to do it</a>.</p>
<p>Looking for more options, I read about the importer ImpOSM, which I understood makes possible to run the functionality of geocoding and Mapnik using one db. Is this correct? If so, is it a good approach?</p>
<p>We are also planning to use OSRM for routing.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate if you can suggest me a way in which we can tackle this issue.</p>
<p>Btw, it's nice to see how active is this community and the great results achieved so far.</p>
<p>Thanks, Juan.</p>
