<p>Hello. I am wondering if there is a way to monitor the current position of a GPS tracker or smartphone, using OSM. So far, I have found livegpstracks.com's free service to be the best. But it would be even better if I could display in my own OSM account not only the subsequently uploaded tracks, but also the current GPS positions and the route taken so far. Is this possible? Thanks, Ben</p>

<p>OSM is basically just a big pile of data. People have written software that can combine that data with "where you currently are", but I don't see how what you are asking for relates to OSM as it currently is now?</p>
<p>This isn't to say that what you're asking for is necessarily a bad isea, just that likely it's probably a good idea for aome non-OSM site somewhere.</p>
