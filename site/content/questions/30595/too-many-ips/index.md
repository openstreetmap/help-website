I am currently testing it while in a call with NOBODY and it is pulling 6 different IPs repeatedly as if I were in a call with them right now. How can I clear out the history, or stop this from happening again? I dont want the IPs blacklisted in any way, incase they are those that I might pull in the future, but I want them to not be spammed when I am just trying to pull a single IP of somebody I am in a call with.
