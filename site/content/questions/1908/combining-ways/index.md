<p>In Potlatch 1, to combine ways you held the shift key down while you connected to another way. This method has been removed from Potlatch 2 and you have to change the way selection from edit mode to select mode, hold Control while you click on the second way and then click on the Combine button in the bottom right hand corner. The new method is very clunky for a function that is used very frequently. Can we please bring back a shortcut that does the same job? Maybe not use the shift key but some other key. The method now used in Potlatch 2 seems to be a backward step. I did look in the Wiki page for suggestions but it's not user friendly.</p>
