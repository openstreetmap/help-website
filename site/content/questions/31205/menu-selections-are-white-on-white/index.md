I've tried Wireshark preferences and View -&gt; Coloring rules, but didn't find anything. This is such a basic problem I would've thought it simple to resolve. X Windows is working for other applications; for example GIMP.</p><p>Running version 1.10.6 on Mac OS X 10.9.2, and using X Windows System Xquartz 2.7.5. I uninstalled Wireshark and removed everything I could find before installing the latest version, yet menu selections are "whited out".
