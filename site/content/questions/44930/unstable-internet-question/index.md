All workstations are running Windows 7/8 and the server is running Windows Server 2008. The workstations at location1 have no issues with the connection being reset due to them being on the same local network. Wireshark shows a handful of duplicate acks and tcp retransmissions right before a tcp reset. The ISP at location1 is experiencing some technical problems and are unsure when they will be resolved. Is there anything I can configure in Windows on these computers to prevent the tcp reset? Maybe in the registry?</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">connection_reset tcp</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>08 Aug '15, 12:01</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/16cc2cfaa993762e4fff663f4e929893?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="alan1337&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>alan1337<br />
