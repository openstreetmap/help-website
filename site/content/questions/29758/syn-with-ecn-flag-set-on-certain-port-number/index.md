How much slower, depends on the capacity of the firewall, the firewall configuration, etc.</p><blockquote><p>Client PC sends packets in different source port <strong>but embedded devices receives it in different port</strong></p></blockquote><p>that's the second sign for the source of the problem. Either there is a transparent proxy on the firewall (see content inspection above) or the port change is the result of a NAT operation. But then you should see a different source IP as well.</p><blockquote><p>My question is why it flags ECN in SYN only after a while and only on specific ports</p></blockquote><p>hard to answer. It depends who sets the ECN flag. If it's the client (browser), it would be kind of strange. If it's the firewall (or a QoS or WAN acceleration device), I would understand it for certain conditions.</p><blockquote><p>I also observed the gateway/proxy inside network slows the packet</p></blockquote><p>Sure. Every proxy will slow down the connection, <strong>compared</strong> to a direct local access, as the proxy might also have content inspection (AV, URL filtering) enabled, which obviously costs some time to perform. How much time it costs, depends on the capacity of the proxy, the proxy configuration and where the proxy is placed in your network.</p><blockquote><p>lease let me know if you need wireshark captures on both ends i have captured at both ends in parallel</p></blockquote><p>Go ahead and post them somewhere (google drive, dropbox, cloudshark).</p><p>However, based on your description and my experience, I recommend to talk to the firewall/proxy admins how to solve the problem by configuring exceptions for your web gui access.</p><p>Regards<br />

It's the (external) clients that do it on their own, because their TCP/IP stack is configured in that way.</p><p><strong>As a result, you'll have to support connections with the ECN flag on your embedded device</strong> if you want to support those clients as well. As an alternative, you could implement a reverse proxy in front of the embedded device, that handles those connections, but I guess that embedded device is meant to be working on its own in the wild, so a reverse proxy is probably not an option.</p></div><div id="comment-29857-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(14 Feb '14, 00:45)</span> Kurt Knochner ♦</div></div><span id="29895"></span><div id="comment-29895" class="comment"><div id="post-29895-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>Please let me know if you need wireshark captures on both ends <strong>i have captured at both ends in parallel</strong></p></blockquote><p>O.K. can you please post <strong>both</strong> capture files?</p></div><div id="comment-29895-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(15 Feb '14, 10:55)</span> Kurt Knochner ♦</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-29846" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-29846-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
