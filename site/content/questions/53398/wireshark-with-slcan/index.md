So what hardware &amp; driver do you use to capture the CAN communication and how is it interfaced to Wireshark?</p></div><div id="comment-53425-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(14 Jun '16, 00:47)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div><span id="53431"></span><div id="comment-53431" class="comment"><div id="post-53431-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>No its not a problem of the order of packets. Thats perfectly fine. The problem is the order of nibbles in the CAN Identifier. In Wireshark it seems the Identifier is represented by a 32-bit variable. A CAN Identifier has 11 or 29 bits. Bit 31 in the wireshark representation contain the additional information if it is an extended identifier (29 bit) or a standard identifier (11 bit). Bit 30 contains the information if its a remote frame. Bit 29 contains the information if its a error frame.</p><p>I have sent only Extended Frames. Data Bytes all 0x00. In the first message i have set nibble 0 of the can identifier to 0xF. In wireshark nibble 6 was 0xF. In the second message i have set nibble 1 of the can identifier to 0xF. In wireshark nibble 7 was 0xF (there are the additional frame informations in wireshark)</p><p>And so on...</p><p>My hardware is custom and im implementing the Lawicel/SLCAN protocol. It is a serial ASCII protocol.</p><p>I'm using the SLCAN kernel module which is the interface between the serial interface and SocketCAN</p></div><div id="comment-53431-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(14 Jun '16, 01:39)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">casartar</span></div></div><span id="53440"></span><div id="comment-53440" class="comment"><div id="post-53440-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I'm still confused by the pictures.</p><p>I've thought that the two screenshots are from the same actual sequence of CAN frames, which is why I've thought that the frame order is wrong (because the <code>F</code> is travelling a different path in the Wireshark screenshot than in the can-utils picture).</p><p>And I wanted a capture file rather than a screenshot because one thing is the order of the fields in the packet dissection pane (the middle one) and the other thing is their order in the packet bytes pane (the lower one which is missing on your screenshot).</p><p>If you click a row in the dissection pane, the corresponding bytes in the packet bytes pane get highlighted. So to see where the issue comes from, I need to compare the order of the bytes in the packet bytes pane with the can-utils capture and with the dissection. This should tell whether it is an issue of endianness (byte order) when generating the capture <del>file</del>stream or an issue of the dissector.</p></div><div id="comment-53440-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(14 Jun '16, 08:35)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div><span id="53455"></span><div id="comment-53455" class="comment"><div id="post-53455-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I finaly managed to get a capture file from wireshark (at least i hope so) <a href="https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/11a2cb7ff337">https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/11a2cb7ff337</a></p><p>The screenshots are from the same actual sequence of CAN frames. The frame order is okay. Its just the nibble and byte order in the CAN identifier which is not correct.</p><p>I thought about the endianness but it would not explain way the nibbles in one byte are switched.</p></div><div id="comment-53455-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(15 Jun '16, 00:47)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">casartar</span></div></div><span id="53458"></span><div id="comment-53458" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-53458-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>To me the nibbles do not seem swapped:</p><p>slcan:</p><pre><code>00 00 00 0f ...
00 00 00 f0 ...
00 00 0f 00 ...
00 00 f0 00 ...</code></pre><p>Wireshark (or rather capture file contents):</p><pre><code>0f 00 00 80 08 88 ff ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
f0 00 00 80 08 88 ff ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 0f 00 80 08 88 ff ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 f0 00 80 08 88 ff ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</code></pre><p>So if you revert the order of the first four bytes (which means if you change their endianness), the nibbles stay at their places, because endianness affects only bytes, not the bits inside them. Order of bits is a difference between "telecom" (most significant bit first) and "datacom" (least significant bit first) serialization and thus is in most cases only interesting on the wire. Exceptions exist but they are mostly related to processing telecom frames using packet network means and correction of bit order is normally part of such setup.</p><p>Wireshark always shows the packet contents as it is stored in the pcap file (or as it was coming to its input). Respecting the endianness of multi-byte fields is a matter of the dissector, not of the capture. So here, the dissector assumes network order (MSB first), but the first four bytes were arriving to the input in intel order (LSB first). What does the CAN specification say about the endianness of this 4-byte field?</p></div><div id="comment-53458-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(15 Jun '16, 03:17)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div><span id="54266"></span><div id="comment-54266" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-54266-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Same problem here on Arch Linux, amd64 architecture.
