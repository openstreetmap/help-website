<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yesterday I tried to descend from the summit of Chwarel y Fan (Wales) by following a footpath on Osmand that does not exist. Despite attempting to follow the path, I eventually encountered a commercial forest of tightly-packed fir trees bounded by barbed-wire fence and no further progress was possible.</p>
<p>Today I wanted to edit OSM to delete the footpath, but when I right-click it says I can't delete it because it is part of a relation. So I removed it from the relation and submitted the change, but I still can't delete the footpath. Do I need to wait for the removal from relation to be approved, or is there some other reason I cannot delete the footpath?</p>
<p>By the way, this is my first edit so I may be doing something wrong.</p>
<p>For information, here are the objects I'm trying to amend.</p>

<p>It looks like <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/190019842">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/190019842</a> was removed from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2566042">https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2566042</a> by you in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/90873094">https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/90873094</a> an hour or so ago - see <a href="http://osm.mapki.com/history/relation.php?id=2566042">http://osm.mapki.com/history/relation.php?id=2566042</a> . However I now get (in iD) "this feature can't be deleted because not enough of it is visible". Presumably in iD there's a way of dealing with that if you're sure that yes, you really do want to delete it?</p>

<p>As an aside, there's a pretty good case for <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2566042">https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2566042</a> not being in OSM at all. It's not signposted and in OSM it's very incomplete, although I presume that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales_Traverse">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales_Traverse</a> .</p>
<p>In addition I can say (from lots of walking in the area) that a lot of what was the "South Wales Traverse" in OSM when I was last there simply didn't correspond to anything on the ground - no path of any sort; just a direct line across upload grass and bog.</p>

<p>Thanks for looking at it. Maybe I did manage to delete it successfully somehow, but the options on the right-click menu (in iD) were all disabled after I removed it from the relation.</p>
<p>I agree that the relation South Wales Traverse appears to be just a disjointed series of paths across the map, but I didn't want to remove it as it's someone else's work. I also don't see how it could be useful to anyone as the South Wales Traverse is a continuous route, according to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>There is a strong argument for getting rid of the SWT relation besides it being incomplete and referring to non-existant paths.</p>
<p>The wiki says "They are not designed to hold loosely associated but widely spread items" which is the case with this one.</p>

<p>Resolved.</p>
<p>I switched to a Chrome-based browser without addons, and I was able to select the path and delete it. Might have just been an issue when using Firefox with ad-blocking addons.</p>
<p>I also got the message "this feature can't be deleted because not enough of it is visible" but when I zoomed out far enough it let me delete it.</p>
