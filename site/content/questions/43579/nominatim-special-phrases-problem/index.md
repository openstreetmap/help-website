<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've installed Nominatim 2.3.1 and it is working. The Special Phrases update took quite awhile (2+ days on a fast VM) to load and seemed to finish without a problem but it doesn't to work. Nominatim is still querying by text matching.</p>
<p>I'm not sure where to start looking for a problem. Perhaps knowing which columns and values in Postgresql 9.3 were added/modified by Special Phrases would be a start.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that Nominatim needs to be "started manually". If this is true, how do I do that?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
