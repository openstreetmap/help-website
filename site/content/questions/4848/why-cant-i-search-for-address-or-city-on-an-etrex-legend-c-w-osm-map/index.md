<p>I have requested and received OSM map builds from two tiles: Philippines and Singapore. I downloaded both the MapSource installer and osm_gmapsupp.zip files, but I've only used the MapSource installers so far.</p>
<p>I installed each map for MapSource, and used JaVaWa GMTK to rename and re-ID each so there were no conflicts. I can open each map (only one at a time) in MapSource (v6.15.6), and can find locations in either by address, city, etc.</p>
<p>After using MapSource to download the Philippines map to my eTrex Legend C, I could also find addresses and cities in the eTrex. But if I download the Singapore OSM map to the eTrex, as soon as I try to do a find by city, the screen shows "None found" and doesn't give me the option of keying-in a name. If I select 'Address' for the find, after entering a number, even before I start to key-in the street name, the pane below says 'None Found', and stays that way as I key-in a name. And so I can't find any addresses in the eTrex.</p>
<p>I CAN find an address using the same map <em>in MapSource</em>, but not after downloading to the eTrex.</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong, or could there be a problem with the map build? Is there another way to get the map into my eTrex so it is searchable?</p>
<p>Thanks, Daniel</p>

<p>if I create a "Mark" and do a "Goto" on the garmin vista HCX I get a choice "off road" or "on road" the latter gives turn by turn info. the download I used (of GB) is tagged as routable.</p>

<p>Hello Daniel</p>
<p>Re your map of the Philippines, how is it, is it quite complete, would you recommend it for traveling there, how did you get it, and how much was it?</p>
<p>Just a few questions</p>
<p>Thanks for your time</p>
<p>Pierre</p>

<p>In answer to "Is there another way...", you might want to have a read of the answers to <a href="/questions/1809/how-to-install-mkgmap?sort=newest">this question</a> . It's a bit more complicated, but running mkgmap yourself to create one gmapsupp.img has a few advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can decide exactly which areas you want maps of; you're not restricted by what someone's offering for download.</p></li>
<li><p>You can customise what appears on the map by editing mkgmap's style files</p></li>
<li><p>You get one file containing all your maps, and city search definitely works without problems (for example, I've created a combined map of Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia using this method and could search for cities in any of them).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Address search is still a bit problematical; the mkgmap developers are working on that.</p>
