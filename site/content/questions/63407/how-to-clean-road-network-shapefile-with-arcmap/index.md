<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Currently, I am working on my Master thesis and I want to assess for my research question whether there is an impact of green areas on the walking (behavior) of (older) adults. Mainly I am working with an agent based modelling software, however I need good shapefiles to import into the software. Currently, I am quite happy with my result in the agent based modelling software, however I feel like that the roads are not that well clean and some roads are not needed, since I am interested in the roads accessible to pedestrians.<br />
Therefore, I have the following questions:</p>
<p>1) Which categories of roads are relevant for pedestrians and what do with unclassified roads -&gt; use or ommit?</p>
<p>2)What is a good way to clean up osm road data in arcmap? -&gt; maybe this question is too broad</p>
