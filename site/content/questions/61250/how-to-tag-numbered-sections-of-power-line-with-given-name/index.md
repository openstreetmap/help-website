<p>I'm mapping Ontario power lines. This document gives detailed information about the grid <a href="https://www.hydroone.com/abouthydroone/RegulatoryInformation/txrates/Documents/G2-01-01.pdf">https://www.hydroone.com/abouthydroone/RegulatoryInformation/txrates/Documents/G2-01-01.pdf</a></p>
<p>As one can see, there are multiple distinct sections of power line bearing the same name. For instance, we have B5D sections 2 through 7. How should this section number be tagged?</p>
<p>It seems incorrect to add an ad-hoc suffix to the name, like "name=B5D3" or "name=B5D section 3", etc. Nor do I want to make up a new tag without good reason, like "line:section=3", but I could find no examples on the wiki or taginfo.</p>
<p>Can someone please advise?</p>

<p>It seems you raised a fair concern: <a href="https://www.hydroone.com/terms-of-use">https://www.hydroone.com/terms-of-use</a> states "7.

<p>Fortunately I hadn't added any new names to the map yet... I'm fairly sure linking is not considered reproduction so I'll leave it up for reference in the question.</p>
<p>Update: the document was filed to the Ontario Energy Board for some regulatory purpose - it's likely these filings are public domain or similar, I'll take a look.</p>
