Gerald then makes a "snapshot" of the source repository, which includes the changes that will go into that release, and does a build. The source tarball for that release is made available, as are binary versions for Windows and OS X. An official release is a bit less risky to run than an arbitrary automated build.</p></div><div id="comment-33682-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(11 Jun '14, 16:01)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Guy Harris ♦♦</span></div></div><span id="33727"></span><div id="comment-33727" class="comment"><div id="post-33727-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Very clear and informative answer. thank you so much!</p></div><div id="comment-33727-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(12 Jun '14, 10:47)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">flora</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-33677" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-33677-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
