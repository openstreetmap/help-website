<p>Do we have an accepted tag for purchasing style in a shop?</p>
<p>Businesses like <code>shop=trade</code> and <code>shop=catalogue</code> often have very little if any stock in the customer area and are typically served either by staff over the counter or by ordering at the counter and going to a service entrance for pickup. Supermarkets and the like are typically the opposite where only restricted goods are served in this way.</p>
<p>Some like <code>shop=warehouse</code> can allow patrons to browse or require them to order at the counter depending on the operator. For some shops, like <code>shop=hardware</code>, there may be a general trend for older shops to be over the counter, while newer ones tend to be "browsable". Others like convenience stores at petrol stations may be browsable for a portion of the day but only served through a window at night.</p>
<p>Do we have a way of tagging this distinction in OSM?</p>
<p>It seems common enough that I feel like I must be missing the right keyword.</p>
