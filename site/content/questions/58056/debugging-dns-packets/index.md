</p><p>I have looked at an almost identical packet from Windows when issuing a PING request. I first did a "ipconfig /flushdns" to make sure I got the DNS query from the PING request. The only thing I see that is different (that I think makes a difference) is that our ethernet controller puts an extra 0x00 as the last byte of the packet, making it 1 larger than the Windows generated DNS packet. Wireshark says it is a VSS Monitoring Ethernet Trailer. What is that? I haven't found anything online that says what that is used for, or if that is my issue or not. Apparently, my ethernet controller does that. If someone says that shouldn't matter, I can post my two packets (my prototype and Windows). Maybe someone can figure out what is different.</p><p>I have gotten DHCP and ARP packets to work, just not the DNS yet.</p><p>Also, does anyone know which packet headers (IPV4, etc) actually require the checksums to be present. I've just not used them (0x00 0x00), and everything seems to work. I'll do the checksums later, but wanted to know if any of them were required in other ethernet packets.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Sutton</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">analysis packet dns</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>13 Dec '16, 15:18</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9f303f38b9221d23f72e6d2e5a651184?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="dodge55&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>dodge55<br />

This means you see the outgoing network packets <em>before</em> they are handled by the NIC. Most network drivers these days offload checksum caclculation of the IP/UDP/TCP layers to the NIC, therefor in the capture they appear invalid, while on the network they are indeed valid.</p><p>As for the calculation of the UDP checksum, you need to calculate it over more than just the UDP part, you need to add a pseudo header and calculate over the pseudo header too.
