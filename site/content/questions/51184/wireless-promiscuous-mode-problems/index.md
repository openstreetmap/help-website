Therefore, even though you're right that without encryption (i.e. after making your AP open as you wrote) it could work, the wireless NIC drivers usually don't care much about promiscuous mode implementation, or simply do not support it at all.</p><p>So to test your solution on a wireless network, you'd have to find one of few wireless NIC models which do support promiscuous mode and install it into your machine A,</p><p>So I'd recommend you to take an Ethernet patchcord and fulfil the submission using wired Ethernet.</p></div><div id="comment-51208-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(25 Mar '16, 14:21)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div><span id="51209"></span><div id="comment-51209" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-51209-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Okay Thank you a lot for your time :) I have a better idea now</p></div><div id="comment-51209-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(25 Mar '16, 14:23)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Salim Bitam</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-51184" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 13 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 8 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-51184-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
