<p>I'm working on adding island s and other features in the Tanana River in Alaska. There are many named sloughs (side channels), islands and in some areas curves or bends that have a name. In my example there is a large bend in the river that has its own name, Harper Bend.</p>
<p>If I break the river at both ends of the curve, I could add the name to the section between the breaks but that doesn't seem right because the river's name isn't changing..<a href="https://bilasport.info/">.</a> Another much more complicated solution would be to break the riverbank into sections and add a name to the one that encompasses the bend.</p>
<p>Suggestions? Opinions?</p>
