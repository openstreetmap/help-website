Thanks again! I've just bought this adapter. It's version 2.

I think you're just right: it's a VirtualBox USB problem, I tried with a BackTrack live cd and the wireless adapter works (I haven't tried it in promiscuous mode, yet). Now, I also remember I've already found a topic somewhere about wireless USB adapter (maybe just this one) not working with VirtualBox. I'll try to find it and see if the problem was solved. I think the "faster" solution is to migrate to VMWare.

TL-WN821N was immediately recognized and worked, except for the fact VMware claims it supports USB 3.0, but it doesn't! :( tsk Then, I tried promiscuous mode: first of all, with my network without password, and I verified the adapter actually works in promiscuous mode; then, I tried with password set on: be aware the version of Wireshark installed in BackTrack 5 R3, 1.8.2, has a bug which gives you error when you enter wpa-psk, so I installed 1.8.4 from Ubuntu repositories, which solved the bug. At this point, I wasn't able to decrypt traffic through my network, since I couldn't get the 4 handshake packets, but only packets 1 and 3. I don't know what's the problem now, if another bug, or just my problem. :(</p></div><div id="comment-17392-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(02 Jan '13, 11:55)</span> Mr Wolf</div></div><span id="17395"></span><div id="comment-17395" class="comment"><div id="post-17395-score" class="comment-score">1</div><div class="comment-text"><p>I have no idea why you cannot see the last packet.
