<p>Can you give an example of exactly which rendering you're talking about here? Mapbox (the company) produces a wide variety of maps for a wide variety of customers, so it's difficult to comment further without a bit more information. If it is a Mapbox rendering that you're talking about, then it's probably best to contact them.</p>

<p>I have enclosed a screenshot from Mapbox (their "Nature" layer which can be seen here when you zoo in: <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/feedback/map/">https://www.mapbox.com/feedback/map/</a> ) and a screenshot from OpenStreetMap of the same area.</p>
<p>Is there a cross reference between OpenStreetMap's meta data and Mapbox's Nature layer anywhere?</p>
<p>I have tried making some changes in OpenStreetMap to the attributes of an exhibit area, but I did not see any change in the Mapbox map rendering. Maybe it is not a real-time sync or I did not edit the right fields.</p>
<p>I have contacted MapBox, but I have not heard back yet. I will report what they say. In meantime, I would greatly appreciate any further guidance you can provide. If there is a simple reference anywhere that would do it.</p>

<p>It looks like they're using an icon for things tagged "tourism=attraction". To take "Chimpanzee" as an example, it's in OSM as a relation <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2764536">https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2764536</a> . Your second screenshot shows the "iD" editor, and you've selected that object in your second screenshot.</p>
<p>Mapbox have made a rendering decision to show a camera icon in the middle of this item in their map. If you'd like them to change that, you'll need to await their reply to your message.</p>

<p>Thanks for replying! I tried removing "tourism=attraction" but have not seen the change take effect in the Mapbox nature layer (it still shows the camera icon). When I hear back from Mapbox, I will post the answer back here.</p>

<p>Please don't remove the "tourism=attraction" if that's a valid description of what's there. Different maps make different decisions about how to show things - Mapbox's map is not the only one. If you remove the tagging it'll disappear from <em>all</em> maps.</p>
<p>Another thing to mention - Mapbox's maps have been quite out of date for a while (for example, edits I made last year haven't appeared) so I wouldn't expect to see any changes on Mapbox's maps no matter what what you do (at least until they start updating again).</p>

<p>I'll second what <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/387/someoneelse">@SomeoneElse</a> wrote. You should never change OSM data because you do not like the rendering on a particular map. Chances are that your action will be labeled as "vandalism".</p>

<p>I understand and will respect that boundary.</p>
<p>If I may, I would like to request further guidance, as this is not a personal view but rather a request from the Zoo executive team taking a pro-active role to improve (in their view) how their zoo is represented - based on how they wish to use OSM. To make this thread more complete, let me ask the question more generally in the following ways:</p>
<p>Case 1: In the case of private property, can / should the land owners be able to manage the OSM attributes for their land?</p>
<p>Case2: In the case of a non-profit that serves the public, can / should the land managers be able to manage their OSM attributes in ways that they feel best serve their mission and guest experience?</p>
<p>Please assume the intentions are noble and not malicious. In both cases, how do you balance the goals / needs of the OSM commmunity with the goals / needs of the those who are responsible for the land management and use?</p>
<p>Maybe the answer rests in how data layers should be modified up the stack, and not here? But still, who should really take ownership of the underlying OSM data?</p>
<p>Thank you (to anyone who may reply) for helping to clarify this important topic.</p>
