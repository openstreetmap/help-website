<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have recorded GPS coordinates of a car which are mapped to the OSM road. In between 2 GPS points, I have recordings of other car sensors and I would like to compute their GPS coordinates along the road.</p>
<p>I am computing the distance of a measurement from a GPS point. Let's say I get 2,2 meters. How can I get a coordinate along the same road which is 2,2 meters away from the GPS point?</p>
<p>I am working in Python.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>
