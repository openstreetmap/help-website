You'll see the Capture Filter field. IN the filter bar, use "host 1.1.1.1 or host 2.2.2.2" (no quotes.) This will capture all traffic to/from those two hosts. Check the "Capture in promiscuous mode" if you're not using the actual server to capture the traffic. Adjust the capture buffer as necessary.</p><p>Earlier versions of Wireshark, the capture filter was in the main screen (after hitting CTRL K). The above is for newer 1.8 releases.</p></div><div id="comment-14237-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(13 Sep '12, 08:10)</span> hansangb</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-14174" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 6 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 1 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-14174-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
