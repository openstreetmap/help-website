The FPGA sends UDP packets to the PC continuously and that works fine. I have written a WinSock application in the PC which just receives the packets and sends a UDP packet to the FPGA once it received 'X' number of packets. Here is the problem:</p><p>The Windows PC is sending 128 packets to the NIC for every single packet that the PC application sends. Let me simplify. When the PC application sends <code>N</code> packets, I see <code>N*128</code> packets at the FPGA end. When I checked the packets with Wireshark, I found that in those 128 packet set, the TTL and the IPv4 Header Checksum are the only fields that change. The TTL decreases to 1 and eventually the packet is destroyed. I really can not understand the behaviour. I am sure my PC application is not buggy because, I tried sending UDP packets from a tool I found online and the same behaviour repeats. Also, this behaviour is true for PINGs as well.</p><p>So, somehow the PC is giving 128 packets to the NIC for every packet generated by the PC App.</p><p>FYI, I have done some tweaks to the NIC properties such as IPv4, UDP checksum offloading and enabling RSS. I have increased the Rx Buffer to 40000 and enabled Jumbo Frames. This is to achieve max data rate.</p><p>I am a beginner in Ethernet. Could anyone please explain this strange behaviour.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags"><span class="post-tag tag-link-10gbe" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;10gbe&#39;">10gbe</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-windows7" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;windows7&#39;">windows7</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-udp" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;udp&#39;">udp</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-winsock" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;winsock&#39;">winsock</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-ttl" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;ttl&#39;">ttl</span></div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>06 Apr '16, 04:08</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2d0c12ec4ba65a366d10432a8e05b331?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="vinaymv&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>vinaymv</span><br />
