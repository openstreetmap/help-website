<p>This help site is about "OpenStreetMap" itself. It sounds like you're asking about some framework or other (which is unclear because I suspect that most have a "map.get" function!).</p>
<p>I'd suggest that you describe in a bit more detail what you're doing (what platform, what framework, what version, what tutorial you're following etc.), and also that you try and find a help site about that particular framework, where you'll get more people familiar with it.</p>
