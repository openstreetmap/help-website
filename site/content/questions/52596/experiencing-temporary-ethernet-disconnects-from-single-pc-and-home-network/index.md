Other PC's on the home network have no issues (either Ethernet or wirelessly connected). When my PC is wirelessly connected, I do not experience these momentary disconnects. I have replaced the Ethernet cable, set a static IP address in my PC adapter card, updated the adapter card driver, all to no avail. I have a Netgear Nighthawk R7000 router which my PC is connected to. The router is Ethernet connected to an optical modem with high speed fiber. Comments and potential fixes are welcome!</p></div><div id="comment-52612-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 May '16, 03:19)</span> Red Creek</div></div><span id="52613"></span><div id="comment-52613" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-52613-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Well now the problem description became detailed enough.</p><p>Wireshark is not too good for debugging L1 issues as it only gives an indirect indication of them. So before posting a capture somewhere at cloudshark (preferred by this site's community), Dropbox, Google drive..., login-free, and posting a link to it here, please interchange cables of two PCs at your Nighthawk to exclude broken port at that box. Swapping the NIC between two PCs would be nice if technically possible (same slot types).</p><p>The issues may be in PC-&gt;switch signal direction so your OS may not report cable disconnections even if the connectors are guilty, let alone hardware failures behind the connectors.</p></div><div id="comment-52613-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 May '16, 03:33)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="52616"></span><div id="comment-52616" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-52616-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Sindy - well, your suggestion to be more specific resulted in my trying your recommendation for port swapping at the router. This appears to have solved the issue much to my pleased amazement!
