<p>Which program do you use for map editing? (JOSM, Potlatch 1, Potlatch2, Merkaator or something else)</p>
<p>And what's the purpose of your map editing? Is is just for uploading new data to OpenStreetMap, or is the intention to use your edited map in for example a GPS unit or some kind of GIS?</p>
<p>If the intention is to upload data to OpenStreetMap there is already a built in function in the latest version om JOSM that makes it possible to show the rendered OSM map in a background layer. Just select Imagery/OpenStreetMap from the main menu.</p>

<p>Not an answer to your initial question, but a minor advise how to use this help forum:</p>
<p>The "Your answer" functionally should not be used to answer follow-up questions, but only for entries that give an answer the initial question. Use "add new comment" instead. Otherwise people looking at the overview will see that your question is already answered and probably care a little bit less. There are other reasons as well.</p>
<p>Fortunately you may convert your answer to a comment yourself by selecting "more/convert to comment" in the menu below your answer.</p>

<p>Sorry, but I still can't get exactly what you are requesting.</p>
<p>You write that one should see the GPS traces in pale blue. Is that the problem? That one should see the traces, but you do not.</p>
<p>I'm not a Potlatch 2 user, but did a fast test looking at old traces. I had to select "GPS data/GPS data" from the menu bar to see the traces.</p>
