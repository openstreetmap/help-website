<p>Can you give a link to an area that shows the problem at the zoom level at which houses were shown previously but now aren't?</p>

<p>Literally anywhere works. When the scale says 250 feet no house outlines are shown, while at 100 feet they are shown. It's definitely a new feature they added, as I just noticed there's a new section at the bottom that says "n hidden features". Unfortunately clicking that "button" doesn't do anything, so I guess it just wants you to know that it's deliberately hiding the information you're trying to edit.</p>

<p>Oh, I see what you're saying now. The building outline suddenly just showed up if I pan the map to certain areas, but if I pan even a few pixels left or right the outlines disappear. Definitely a bug rather than a design decision.</p>
