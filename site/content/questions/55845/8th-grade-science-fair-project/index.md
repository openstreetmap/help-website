If HTTP, it means that anyone can read what is going on, and may potentially grab passwords, cookies, password hashes, user IDs etc. from it.</p><p>Surfing via VPN is more safe that without - all an eavesdropper can see is the encrypted channel, but not what's communicated inside of it. There are standard VPN protocols like IPSec (which Wireshark will list as protocol), and standard ports like UDP 1194 used by OpenVPN.</p><p>I think it would make sense to sample at least half a dozend of locations and count how many connections are encrypted, and what people are doing. # of HTTP connections vs. # of HTTPS connections and # of VPN connections, maybe as a breakdown per IP address (=devices/persons). For this the statistics functions of Wireshark are really helpful: endpoints (IP tab), conversations (IP tab) and protocol distribution.</p><p>Best would be to experiment with your own laptop first - capture with Wireshark while surfing to a HTTP site before surfing to an HTTPS site. Then try to spot which conversation in the capture is what. Keep in mind that web pages often contain multiple elements, which can lead to multiple connections.</p></div><div id="comment-55864-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(26 Sep '16, 09:55)</span> Jasper ♦♦</div></div><span id="55865"></span><div id="comment-55865" class="comment"><div id="post-55865-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Jasper - I REALLY appreciate your answers and assistance.

Capturing in the air requires that your hardware and drivers support monitoring and promiscuous modes simultaneously, which is currently only "guaranteed" for Apple devices; on both Windows and Linux, it is a matter of luck but you may give it a try, using the guidelines in those other questions. On Windows, use of a version of NPcap which supports monitoring mode is just one of the prerequisites, the newest ones seem not to.</p></div><div id="comment-56073-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(02 Oct '16, 10:22)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="56138"></span><div id="comment-56138" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-56138-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Jasper,</p><p>We have switched to a MacBook Pro and still don't seem to be picking up traffic other than the our own.

McDonalds seems to use HTTPS (surprise, but not a bad thing other than making things harder for you)</p><p>If not, check if you get anything when filtering for "tcp.port==80", and compare IP addresses with your own.

For that, the WLAN either has to be open (no encryption used), or you have to provide Wireshark with enough information to decrypt it. As you wrote your home WLAN is password protected, read the wiki and threads regarding WLAN decryption. In short - in order to decrypt WPA successfully, you have to capture the key negotiation phase, the famous "4 EAPOL packets". So you must start capturing on the macbook in monitoring mode, switch WLAN off on the iPhone, switch it on again and then access the web site from the iPhone. Or you may switch off encryption of your WLAN for a while if your neighbours are not too quick. If, using one of the two methods above, you can see in the capture some packet which has a source IP address which is unicast and different from your PC and the access point while a display filter <code>tcp</code> is applied, that address should be the iPhone's one and you've won.</p></div><div id="comment-56142-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(04 Oct '16, 12:00)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="56299"></span><div id="comment-56299" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-56299-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Jasper, et. al. -</p><p>We've finally been able to capture traffic from other devices - how cool!

If the person doesn't do their e-mails, this doesn't help, so look for access to plain HTTP (port 80).

The situation with public wifi is that it is unencrypted in most cases, to allow people to easily connect to it without having to ask for a password first. Which means that you can consider almost all public wifi locations unprotected, as anyone with a wifi card can capture everything everybody else does (e.g. with Wireshark). With Windows this would require a special adapter (AirPCAP), but on Linux or MacOS you can use almost any adapter.</p><p>What may be interesting to ask instead is "how well do people of public wifi protect themselves?" - this would be something your son could investigate using Wireshark. He'll need to read up and check for people surfing using HTTPS (encrypted HTTP, needs to be provided by the web page server, and the user needs to use it instead of HTTP) or surfing via a VPN (user responsibility to use one). To do that he could check how many plain text conversations he can find compared to how much encrypted stuff is found.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>26 Sep '16, 08:35</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c578ba2967741f25aebd6afef702f432?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Jasper&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Jasper ♦♦<br />

If nobody is interested in your question you'll not get an answer. So make it interesting.</p><p>And honestly, your original question was completely nondescript. We're not going to do your work for you. We're going to help with specific questions (Example: "I need to find suspicious HTTP requests, how can I filter on requests?"). Demanding solutions will get you one thing only: silence.</p></div><div id="comment-55861-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(26 Sep '16, 09:07)</span> Jasper ♦♦</div></div><span id="55862"></span><div id="comment-55862" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-55862-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>To be honest it's a beginner task so I thought that someone experienced here could quickly find the identity and what's going on and tell how he did it</p></div><div id="comment-55862-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(26 Sep '16, 09:21)</span> micegreen</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-55847" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 15 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 10 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-55847-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
