<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>other people seem to have had this problem already, but I could not find a viable solution for my case. I have a UMap with some location markers that show projects. This UMap is shown in an iframe embedded on the projects' website. Each project has its own page with detailed information. I have put a link to each project's page in the marker description, but I would like these links to open in the window with the iframe page, since they are all on the same website.</p>
<p>I found a little script on the web which I tried:</p>
<pre><code>function onLoadIF(frame)
{
    var elements = frame.getElementsByTagName(&#39;a&#39;),
        len = elements.length;
&#10;    while( len-- ) {
        elements[len].target = &quot;_parent&quot;;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This doesn't work however, since the map is also generated by javascript. Is there any way of accessing those links in the descriptions by javascript so I can change their <code>target</code>s?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance for your ideas and help!</p>
