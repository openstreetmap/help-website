<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>It's been a wile since I last used OSM.org and I've noticed that my registration e-mail address is one that is no longer available (it was discontinued by the owner company).</p>
<p>I've tried to register a "New Email Address", under "My Settings", but, at login, is the old e-mail address that is still the accepted one.</p>
<p>I know that I could use the Username at login, instead of the e-mail address, but mainly, I would like to make the new e-mail address the one to be associated.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support!</p>
