<p>what to do? just wait, do nothing about it (unless you are a map style programmer, brown stuff coastline expert or something), and continue your mapping! :-)</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> in the meantime (2015-04-28 06:12:44 UTC) this has (<em>apparently</em>) been solved. The cause was the accidental move of a Finnish building corner into the USA: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2082813401/history">https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2082813401/history</a> . The colour seemed to be the one of the building outlines. Also see the discussion on <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/30558325">https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/30558325</a> .</p>
<p>The tiles, which were rendered brown during the bad edit was active, need to be re-rendered which <a href="/questions/178/how-often-does-the-main-mapnik-map-get-updated">can take some time</a>. Just wait and continue your mapping as usual! :-).</p>
