<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would like to ask about the possibilities of these settings:</p>
<p>I often use validator..isn't it possible to change in advanced settings that the menu is already expanded? I always keep an eye on what errors are there, I find it unnecessary to always have to click to expand the menu</p>
<p><a href="https://ibb.co/zhZWrt3">https://ibb.co/zhZWrt3</a></p>
<p>I also use the filter often, when switching the filter on or off, the panel is maximized on the right..I would like it to be minimized all the time, I don't need it to maximized all the time..is it possible to change this?</p>
