<p>There seems to be some dispute about the correct use of highway=pedestrian.</p>
<p>For some people, the tag should be used for <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/File:Infotafel_-_Lloydpassage_(Lage).jpg">shopping streets</a>, (town) squares, and roads that are signed as pedestrian zones (<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/File:G%C3%A5gade_-_K%C3%B8rsel_tilladt.jpg">regardless of dimensions</a>).</p>
<p>But for others, it can be any road that is designated pedestrians, but that is dimensioned to allow (emergency/service/delivery) vehicles. (On which the first group then can reply that such vehicles often use <em>any</em> kind of path.)</p>
<p>Some specific roads/paths I am struggling with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/File:Highway%3Dpedestrian_on_cemetery.JPG">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/File:Highway%3Dpedestrian_on_cemetery.JPG</a> (from the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dpedestrian">highway=pedestrian wiki page</a>)</li>

</ul>
<p>I used to be in the second camp, but I've recently gotten several comments that I should only use highway=pedestrian for pedestrian zone kind of streets.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? I think the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dpedestrian">relevant wiki page</a> should be updated to avoid ambiguity, but what should we say there?</p>

<p>None of those examples I would tag as hw=pedestrian just from the looks.</p>
<p>But I don't think discussing such fundamental matters is really in scope of this help site. I would say you are better off discussing this on the tagging mailing list.</p>

<p>I agree with TZorn in that I wouldn't tag any of those three examples as pedestrian. I'd tag them as highway=service, possibly also service=alley on the second one. I can't really give you a good, objective reason for doing so, though. I think that's why people struggle with this tag.</p>
