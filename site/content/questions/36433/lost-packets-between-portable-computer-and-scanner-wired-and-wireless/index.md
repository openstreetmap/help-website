I looked at the lost packets, with wired there were 10 packets lost in 5 minutes and wireless there were like 159 lost packets in 5 minutes. I don't know the reason what causes this and need help. There are also alot of retransmissions, I don't know what's good and what isn't. Can someone tell me what causes the lose of the packets and how I can get this to a minimum? Our customer wants to use the setup as wireless that's why I need t optimize it to work well with wireless.</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p><p><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=CE78C1CB2CAB3EE6!155&amp;authkey=!ACVWMy7ZdNbdBJM&amp;ithint=folder%2c">https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=CE78C1CB2CAB3EE6!155&amp;authkey=!ACVWMy7ZdNbdBJM&amp;ithint=folder%2c</a></p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">wireless computer wired scanner portable</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>18 Sep '14, 06:02</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/79b5e3fff33e57e08ffb6426b75de367?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Cihad%20Palta&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Cihad Palta<br />
