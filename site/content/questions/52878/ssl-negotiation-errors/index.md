The first is closed by the client when the PayPal server requests the client certificate. The second completes the TLS handshake but after some encrypted data is exchanged the PayPal server closes the connection. The third and fourth attempts are replicates of the first and second respectively.</p><p>Conclusion; your client is misbehaving in closing the connection after the server sends the client certificate request, and on the 2 instances where encrypted data is exchanged, the PayPal server has either finished the transaction or doesn't like the data from the client.</p><p>In the capture "Exported TLS success" there is the same behaviour, only more TLS connection attempts.</p><p>In all cases where encrypted data transferred, your client sent ~400 bytes and the server responded with ~1k bytes.</p><p>You'll probably need to look at your application logs as we're unable to look into the encrypted data.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>25 May '16, 10:40</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d2a7e24ca66604c749c7c88c1da8ff78?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="grahamb&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>grahamb ♦<br />

Both the failure and success were done from the same machine executing the exact same code. The only difference is the PayPal server. They have multiple (10) servers responding to requests to api.paypal.com. Our code has worked flawlessly for the past 5 years. Two weeks ago they added the 10th server to their group and the failures only occur when the new server answers our call.
