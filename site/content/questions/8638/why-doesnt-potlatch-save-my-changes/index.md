<p>My problem now is that when edit something with potlatch (on my server at port 3000) and i click the save button, potlatch is stuck at: "contacting server...". My server is on, map works perfectly, i can edit, but can't save.</p>
<p>The server's console doesn't seem to output anything after i press the save button in potlatch. Perhaps potlatch is not configured to contact my server, i don't know. And i don't know how to check that.</p>

<p>I don't know what else is really needed. Should i copy paste all the links to the tutorials i've followed? Btw, I don't have time to get into a lot of tedious details that can be unnecessary. It's not that i'm disrespectful by saying that. Its just an approach that i have: i post my question, describe it as relevant as i think it should, and if i leave something 'vital' untackled then pls ask for.</p>
<p>On the other hand i post daily so many questions here that sometimes i assume many understand my background.</p>

<p>The problem with "I post daily ... I assume many understand my background" is that this question-and-answer site is designed to allow people to search for questions related to problems that they're having and find answers. Your question above doesn't give any sort of context (for example, it doesn't say that you're running your own server and trying to edit on that)...</p>

<p>... Also, a better-formed question would link back to your previous questions, perhaps something like "Thanks to the the answers to $question I've just solved $problemX, but am now getting $problemY". Also some sort of description of what does or doesn't happen when you try and fail to save would help - Do you get some sort of error client or server-side? Do you get any evidence at all that suggests that Potlatch is trying to contact your server at all? Do purple elephants parade across the screen?</p>
