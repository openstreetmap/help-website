<p>I am trying to generate training data for bunch of ML jobs which take maps as inputs. I'd like to pair each raster tile with its vector data. For example, a map text recognition (OCR) job needs raster images paired with their text labels and label locations (bounding box). To generate a diverse set of styles, I'd like the framework to support map styling.</p>
<p>OpenStreetMap is a good option, but it seems not to support different styles.</p>
<p>I came across OpenMapTiles, installed it on a server and played around with it, but I couldn't find a way to pair the raster maps with vector data. Am I missing something? With OpenStreetMap, one can get a PNG file paired with an SVG. But I don't think OpenMapTiles has an SVG endpoint. I was able to get the GeoJSON file for each tile, but there isn't a 1:1 correspondence between the GeoJSON features and the raster map (GeoJSON has a lot of data which are not rendered).</p>
<p>I am open to try different tools if OpenStreetMap or OpenMapTiles are not recommended. I'd like the final solution to be open source and open data.</p>
