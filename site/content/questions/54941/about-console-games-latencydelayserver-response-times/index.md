For my understanding for UDP packets this could be relatively challenging(?) I know games usually display the ping but this data is not recordable or saved anywhere, so that's out of the question.</p><p>It would be relatively important for the project to be able to measure data like this. We are video capturing with a high speed camera each test iteration. Any insight or shed of light to if it is even possible to do would be really appreciated. Sorry if this question isn't clear enough, I am willing and hope for questions to arise on information that I maybe have forgot to ask or provide in this post.</p><p>Thanks.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">delay latency wireshark response_time server</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>18 Aug '16, 02:50</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/230069e70e95296ad1a51a56a710386f?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="tchtony&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>tchtony<br />
