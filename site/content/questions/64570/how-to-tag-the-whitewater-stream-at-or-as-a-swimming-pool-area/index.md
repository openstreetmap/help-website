<p>I have enjoyed a couple of these at the Oasis Bedford UK and Perth in Scotland. I couldn't find a a good tag. Maybe Flume although these have steeper gradient more like a water slide. I like man made swimming stream but that name is too long. The streams that have pumped flow of about 7km/h are fun as you can try to swim or wade upstream or float down. Adventure leisure pool may describe the area.</p>
