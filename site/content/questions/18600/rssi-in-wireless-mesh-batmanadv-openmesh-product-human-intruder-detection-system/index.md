So, if you want to capture the signal strength (RSSI) for every node (AP), you would have to place a sniffer next to each AP or at least in the middle of each AP pair or at a 'central' location where you see the signal of all APs. That's an impractical approach for a large number of APs and the less sniffer systems you deploy, the less accurate the results will be. Imagine just one sniffer system 'in the middle' of a large room. Yes, it will see all signals, but there are so many things that reduce signal quality that it will be hard to read any meaningful data from the recorded RSSI of all signals. Furthermore, the capturing hardware is usually only able to monitor one channel at once. If some APs change their channel (to improve signal quality) you will miss the signals of those APs.</p><p>That's why it is probably better to read those values directly from the wifi hardware of the APs itself. However you need APs that allow access to that kind of data, which is usually only possible with an open (source) firmware (OpenWRT, dd-wrt, etc.).</p><p>BTW: Do you know these papers?</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.apsipa.org/proceedings_2011/pdf/APSIPA259.pdf">http://www.apsipa.org/proceedings_2011/pdf/APSIPA259.pdf</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~anindya/Paul_Wan_Plans08.pdf">http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~anindya/Paul_Wan_Plans08.pdf</a></li><li><a href="http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/13525/InTech-Indoor_location_tracking_using_received_signal_strength_indicator.pdf">http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/13525/InTech-Indoor_location_tracking_using_received_signal_strength_indicator.pdf</a></li></ul><p>Anyway.
