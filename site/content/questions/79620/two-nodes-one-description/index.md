<p>I aim to plot all the streetlights in the parish, for maintenance purposes. I therefore created a temporary dummy streetlight, to familiarise myself with the process. In doing so, I also spotted a nearby feature that was wrong. A bridge over the drain/dyke was tagged as an isolated dwelling. I inserted a description of the change I wanted to make ("Marked as isolated dwelling. Is actually just a bridge over the drain"), but then couldn't find a way to tag the feature as a bridge so deleted it. I think it is/was Node 2917742035 Then I created my dummy streetlight a few metres away. Node 8621207054, if that helps. But this item has the same description. "Marked as isolated dwelling. Is actually just a bridge over the drain". Someone please tell me what I have done wrong and how to fix it, please.</p>

<p>Hi, Your name/handle for editing is different from the one you've registered for this help forum. You can see your changesets edits here:- <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Barrie1956">https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Barrie1956</a> just click edits.</p>
<p>I've properly added the bridge and house then tagged names to the bridge, drain, and house. I made a comment to this effect on your changeset.</p>
<p>Your streetlight is this node:- <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/8621207054">https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/8621207054</a> You shouldn't upload test objects to OSM but I've left it for now so you can see it. I don't think it's a streetlight so could you remove it please. Need any more help please just ask.</p>

<p>I've edited my profile to make the two handles the same.</p>
<p>I did see your comment on my changeset, thank you. I was still fussing over the inappropriate description of my street lamp but, since I shouldn't have created a test object in the first place, I have just deleted it, which fixes both issues.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
