If it's a mapped network drive, then that may very well be the reason for the bulk of the processing time - i.e, remote file access. Have you tried copying the capture files locally to your <code>C</code> drive or running <code>tshark</code> on the device that hosts the capture files instead?</p><p>You could try running <code>tshark</code> at a higher priority? See: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/191771">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/191771</a>.</p><p>You might also try to disable name resolution by specifying the <code>-n</code> option. See: <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html">https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html</a>.</p><p>What is the percent of traffic that matches the filter vs. the total traffic in each capture file? If it's a much smaller subset, then perhaps swapping the filter order would help? In other words, if you're not matching very many <code>myprotocol.BYTE_COUNT &gt; 0</code> packets, then maybe that should be the first condition, because if it's false, then it should short-circuit the rest of the checks, although I'm not entirely sure if short-circuiting actually occurs or not as I see no mention of this on the <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark-filter.html">wireshark-filter man page</a>.</p><p>-R "(myprotocol.BYTE_COUNT &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 || ip.addr == 192.168.1.2 || ip.addr == 192.168.2.1 || ip.addr == 192.168.2.2) &amp;&amp; !(arp || icmp || icmpv6 || dns || nbns || browser || dhcpv6 || igmp || dhcpfo || bootp || http || ip.flags == 0x01 || ip.fragment.count &gt;= 2))"</p><p>You could possibly replace <code>ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 || ip.addr == 192.168.1.2</code> with <code>ip.addr == 192.168.2.0/30</code> if you know that .0 or .3 are not present, and similarly for <code>ip.addr == 192.168.2.1 || ip.addr == 192.168.2.2</code>.</p><p>Perhaps you could modify your Lua script to add a new field whenever it meets your filter criteria above so that you'd only have to specify a filter of <code>"myprotocol.packetofinterest"</code>, for example?</p><p>Other suggestions on the Wireshark wiki's <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/Performance">Performance</a> page may or may not be helpful to you, but you might want to have a look in case.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>13 May '16, 13:02</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/55158e2322c4e365a5e0a4a0ac3fbcef?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="cmaynard&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>cmaynard ♦♦<br />

Definitely would not want to do this job over the network.</p><p>I can't find a way to consistently run tshark at high priority in batch. While it's running, I can click on it in task manager and up it's priority. But as soon as my batch job moves to the next file, the next tshark is invoked at normal and I can't sit here for that long tending to it. Also, I can't get the "start" command to work with all the parameters I'm passing, plus I'm using the STDOUT to read the data in to another program which I don't think I can do with the start command, anyway. Now, I've read STDOUT is slow and there's a suppression switch to use to make Tshark faster by not using it. But my only option other than STDOUT is to write to a file, and the files this would write out to are huge!!! The program reading them in is automatically compressing the data so it doesn't take up too much space on my drive (I have a 2 TB drive and it's 75% used up from this data).</p><p>I've tried a few different combinations of re-arranging my filters. It actually seems like the one I started with is the fastest (slightly). arp is definitely my most common unwanted packet type, so it being first makes sense. I've tried not filtering, only filtering arp, not doing the ip filtering, and a few different orders. All changes so far have made it slower. Of course, there are many permutations of those options, so I can keep trying. Yeah, I'm not sure if it really short-circuits or not. Guess I was assuming since the &amp;&amp; and || short circuit in C++. But, the order does seem to affect the speed slightly, so maybe it does.</p><p>As for the IPs I just gave those as examples. I have to cherry pick certain IPs that are not contiguous and I specifically only want the data from some of them and not the others for a given report.</p><p>The Performance page looks like mostly GUI changes. Can't see much applicable to Tshark specifically, and none that apply to me.</p><p>But thanks for looking into it. I'm sure some of these tips will be good on other projects.</p></div><div id="comment-52536-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(13 May '16, 13:17)</span> Trashman</div></div><span id="52539"></span><div id="comment-52539" class="comment"><div id="post-52539-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>If nothing else, I'd highly recommend disabling name resolution.</p><p>As for changing priority, in the past I've also used WMIC to do this.

Kind of a clunky thing for me to do, but I ran a 9th batch script in parallel that prioritizes all my "tshark.exe" process to "High Priority" every 10 seconds. Since I'm running so many at a time, it's not making a huge difference (they're fighting each other for resources) but a few seconds is shaved on each pass so it should save some hours over the weekend. Since I want to get this report done this weekend, that's what I'll have to do for now. I'll try a more elegant solution for my next reports.</p></div><div id="comment-52553-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(13 May '16, 14:59)</span> Trashman</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-52535" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 6 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 1 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-52535-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

When I do my next set of reports, I'll give this a try.</p><p>I was thinking that arp and the other protocols I filtered out are "higher level" than "myprotocol" (which is wrapped inside ethernet/ip/udp/myprotocol). I guess I had an implicit assumption that it would filter out "higher" layers without having to try to dissect "lower" layers and was saving me some time. Also, since it needed lua to dissect "myprotocol" that I was somehow bypassing calling my script some by doing so. But now that I think about it, that's some pretty complex logic to try to do that. It would have to specifically rank all possible protocols and then check for them in some priority order. It would also have to preprocess the filter directive and resort them internally. I'm sure it doesn't do that. So, by necessity it has to dissect first.</p><p>However, oddly, I did cut out large portions of my filter in some of my attempts and it seemed to make it slower, so I'm not sure this will work. That being said, the first thing I cut out of the filter was the myprotocol.BYTE_COUNT. Didn't try leaving that in and taking the rest out. Maybe that will work. The IPs do have to always be in the filter or I won't get the right data.</p></div><div id="comment-52551-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(13 May '16, 14:52)</span> Trashman</div></div><span id="52617"></span><div id="comment-52617" class="comment"><div id="post-52617-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>A couple more (fairly obvious) optimizations:</p><ul><li>Strip your Lua dissector down to the bare bones: only do enough work to determine BYTE_COUNT.
