<p>I have some links to Google Maps that I want to replace with OpenStreetMap ones. They are of <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=SP1%202DH">this</a> form. I can enter the postcode into OSM, zoom in to show individual buildings, Share and 'include marker' to get a link like <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.06687&amp;mlon=-1.79452#map=18/51.06687/-1.79452">this</a> It looks much better than the Google version. Only problem, I have 200 of them to convert! Is there a way to generate the OSM links from the UK postcode? Looking up the lat/long coords for each would be a pain and would require some scripting, and ideally I can generate usable OSM links by inserting the postcode itself. But whenever and whatever I try, I don't get a permanently visible marker, and the zoom level is great for mountain ranges, not so much for the individual streets I'm interested in.</p>

<p>Well, I can only conclude that this forum is very inactive!</p>
<p>I think therefore that the answer is 'no', and that the solution requires the postcode to be replaced by its lat/lon coordinates. I think I have a practical way to do this and will post it here when I've tested it.</p>

<p>UK postcodes are particularly patchy in OSM as they are rarely signposted and there often seem to be issues with the "open" database releases.</p>

<p>This is what I did! There were 1200 postcodes not 200, but this is seemed appropriate technology for the task.</p>
<p>I extracted the postcodes, one to a line.</p>
<p>I pasted them into Chris Bell's excellent <a href="https://www.doogal.co.uk/BatchGeocoding.php">Batch Geocoder</a>, selecting Comma-separated and Input postcode, to give output lines of the form "AB24 3TU",57.166749,-2.104203</p>
<p>I converted these with find-and-replace in an editor into the PHP code for an associative array and wrote a PHP script to insert map links in the format <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=$lat&amp;mlon=$lon#map=17/$lat/$lon">https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=$lat&amp;mlon=$lon#map=17/$lat/$lon</a> where 17 is the zoom level and $lat and $lon are the values in the second and third CSV fields.</p>
<p>Obviously there are many other ways to get the same result but this worked for a one-off job of finite size.</p>
