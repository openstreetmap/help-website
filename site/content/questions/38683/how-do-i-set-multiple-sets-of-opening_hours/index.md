<p>Yesterday, at an #osmgeoweek event, I was mapping some food pantries that exist in churches. The churches were often marked amenity = place_of_worship. I added amenity_1 = social_facility, social_facility=food_bank to some of the churches. However, I did not know what to do with the opening_hours because the church would have different hours than the food pantry, and I was unsure how to denote which set of hours went with what amenity.</p>

<p>Incidentally, aside from the opening hours, if one facility exists within another larger one I'd use "amenity=place_of_worship" on the church building and then add a separate "amenity=social_facility" (or whatever) on the food bank. That way you can tag opening hours separately of course.</p>
