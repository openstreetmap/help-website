<p>Many places in the UK, continental Europe and Russia look very much complete and well though-out. (Some, I hate to say, even look overdone, but that's nothing that better rendering stylesheets cannot resolve; more data is almost unquestionably better than less). These places are often linked for reference when questions are answered.</p>
<p>Is there similarly a state or an area in the US that someone considers very well mapped, either due to one's own efforts or just as a matter of fact? I am interested in two levels of goodness:</p>
<ol>
<li>Good mapping and tagging of admin borders and places from counties (parishes elsewhere) to cities to suburbs.</li>
<li>Good mapping of cities, complete with landuse, neighborhoods, proper classification of roads, access, POIs, etc.?</li>
</ol>
<p>For one, I think Southern California is a god-awful mess. But I will not set out fixing it until I can visualize what it is supposed to look like. Seeing someone's successful effort elsewhere would help.</p>
<p>Please link as many places that fit or approach your standard of "goodness" as you wish, I don't think there will be wrong or unappreciated answers.</p>

<p>I suggest you take this question to the <a href="http://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-us">talk-us mailing list</a> which is better suited for the rather broad request you're making (see also the <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/faq/">FAQ for this help site</a>, especially the section about questions that should be avoided).</p>
<p>You might also want to check out <a href="http://www.bestofosm.org"></a><a href="http://bestofosm.org"></a><a href="http://bestofosm.org">bestofosm.org</a> which lists a few well-mapped places in the US.</p>
