<p>Strange! I just did a search on "apostrophe", and see that "Apostrophes are now working". Went back to the street in question, and tried adding the apostrophe. It worked. I used the iD editor to add it. I may have been using a different editor whenit didn't tak the apostrophe.</p>
<p>Please ignore my question.</p>
