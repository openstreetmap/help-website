<p>first i thought i solve the problem by adding tag:area=no, nothing happened. At time of creating of the route I added tag:surface=ground, i removed this tag too.</p>
<p>i deleted cache of browser, but nothing happened. Perhaps it will take some time to "re-render" - but I´m not sure and i don´t think so....</p>
<p>I´m using JOSM....</p>

<p>Hello everybody!</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for your professionell answers.</strong> I´m absolute beginner on OSM....</p>
<p>Although I have studied an official "beginner´s tutorial", i mixed objects and relations (it was written in big letters to take care about that....). I will wait until rendering is finished, then i´m going to recreate the relation.</p>

<p>The same issue has been raised recently to the italian ML: <a href="http://gis.19327.n8.nabble.com/Lago-di-Nemi-td5901968.html">http://gis.19327.n8.nabble.com/Lago-di-Nemi-td5901968.html</a> This one was your relation <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/7610762/history">https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/7610762/history</a> The wrong tag there is higway=path, you can re-create the relation without that tag. Rendering apart, the hiking relation itself is not a path, but a sequence of paths (and/or other kinds of ways). There is likely a bug in OMS-carto which causes closed routes with an highway=* tag being rendered as polygon, see also <a href="https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/2808">https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/2808</a></p>

<p>For info, I raised an issue similar to this as <a href="https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/1967">https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/1967</a> . Whether it's actually a "bug" in OSM Carto is a moot point, since (in at least the cases of the "area highways" I was trying to avoid) they'd been mapped deliberately, unlike your accidental example.</p>

<p>I think it is in the process of re-rendering as that part of the map currently looks different at different zoom levels. So it will probably be back to normal soon enough.</p>
<p>As to what went wrong in the first place: were you trying to add ways (the physical paths or tracks on the ground), or a route relation (a collection of ways that make up a route, often waymarked or signposted)? Your tags look like a mixture of both - normally highway=path would be a way, whereas type=route would be a relation. Maybe that was what caused the problem, although it is hard to be sure as the object is deleted.</p>
