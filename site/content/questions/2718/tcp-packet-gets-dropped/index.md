The DATA block sent in these TCP segments is 1448, which will be 1514 captured at wire. I guess this is okay with ethernet as previous segments with same size are sent and received without any issues.

The most common cause for this is that the "TCP timestamp option" is used (RFC 1323).

I'm curious, one thing you could try is to extract frames 5115 to 5118 from the trace on the server and save them in a small tracefile. Then replay them (again from the server) with bittwist.
