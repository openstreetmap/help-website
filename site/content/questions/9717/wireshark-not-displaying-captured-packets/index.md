While I do not claim that my answer is the definitive solution to <a href="https://ask.wireshark.org/users/2409/soumya0800">Soumya0800</a>'s problem, the symptoms, as described, reminded me of the practical joke, thus I provided this answer in case it was indeed the source of the problem. If it's not, then there's no harm and we've at least narrowed down the problem a little bit by ruling out this particular situation. I suppose in your view any answer that does not definitively solve a problem is not constructive?</p><p>And how do you know that it's not the source of the problem? Has Soumya0800 provided some feedback to you, because no feedback has been provided here?
