Then 'follow the cable' to the system.</p><p>If you operate a WLAN, please check that as well (weak passwords or other vulnerabilities).</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p><p>The title (Dell ESG PCBA Test) (finally) made me curious :-)</p><p>Now, I believe there is a typo in the MAC address. Instead of <strong>10</strong>:18:8B it should read: <strong>00</strong>:18:8B, which is indeed a MAC prefix used by DELL. Unfortunately there is not much useful information out there about those MAC addresses and why/where they are used. Strange thing. Anyway, please try to find the switch port and then follow the cable. Maybe it belongs to a Dell DRAC board or something.</p><p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p><p>That MAC prefix is mentioned in the following document, in the context of a Blade Server Chassis.</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/extras/m/white_papers/20400006/download.aspx">http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/extras/m/white_papers/20400006/download.aspx</a></p></blockquote><p>Also here:</p><blockquote><p><a href="ftp://ftp.dell.com/Manuals/all-products/esuprt_electronics/esuprt_software/esuprt_remote_ent_sys_mgmt/dell-chassis-mgmt-cntrllr-v4.1_Reference%20Guide_en-us.pdf">ftp://ftp.dell.com/Manuals/all-products/esuprt_electronics/esuprt_software/esuprt_remote_ent_sys_mgmt/dell-chassis-mgmt-cntrllr-v4.1_Reference%20Guide_en-us.pdf</a></p></blockquote><p>As the MAC address of the BMC interface.</p><blockquote><p>BMC info: <a href="http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/power/ps4q04-20040110-Zhuo.pdf">http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/power/ps4q04-20040110-Zhuo.pdf</a></p></blockquote><p>Conclusion: That MAC address seems to be related to DRAC/BMC.</p><p>Regards<br />

I will give you a summary if this turns out to be my culprit. I am about 99% sure they used a network here to get access to my personal laptop.</p><p>I have checked all machines running that would have a mac addrs to no avail.

What I did find I did not really understand.</p><p>The network I am on only has two laptops, one wireless printer (rarely used), one desktop, two business type desktops that are not online and used for receipts and other business forms, and a security system.
