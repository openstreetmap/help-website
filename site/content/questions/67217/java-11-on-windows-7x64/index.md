<p>When I launch JOSM in Windows I get a warning about serious bugs in Java 10 advising me to upgrade to Java 11. But I actually already have Java 11 installed, as well as 9 and 8. when I click the button to upgrade Java to v11, I'm taken to a webpage to install Java 8; which obviously seems counter-intuitive since that's a significantly older version than 11. It's especially odd since I've already have Java 8 installed. I guess that is sort of a <a href="/questions/67218/update-to-java-11-buttonlink-leads-to-java-8-windows-7x64-v14460">separate side issue</a> that someone (a developer I'd imagine?) should probably look into.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to resolve is: 1. How do I get JOSM to recognize and use Java 11 which is already installed OR... Perhaps I haven't installed Java 11 properly, or I didn't install the correct package. It's a lot to sort out, but I understand that there are major changes with Java 11. There is no JRE for one thing. So I installed the open JDK. 2. Where, and how, and which package(s) of Java 11 must I install for JOSM? And is there any post installation procedure needed to get JOSM to use Java 11?</p>
<p>If this has been answered or explained elsewhere, I apologize! I was unable to anything helpful pertaining to my problem. Perhaps placing a link here would help others users seeking similar information to find it more easily.</p>
<p>Thank you so much! Any insight, direction and/or assistance will be sincerely appreciated!</p>

<p>To run JOSM with java 11 I would suggest to find out the path to your Java 11 java.exe and run it in a command line window. For example(!)</p>
<pre><code> C:\Program Files\Java\11\jre\bin\java.exe -jar C:\Program Files\JOSM\josm-tested.jar</code></pre>
<p>(At least when executing this way) you need to change your thinking: Not JOSM uses Java, but a Java virtual machine runs JOSM.</p>
<p>Unless you need to run other Java programs with specific versions of Java there is no reason to have several versions of Java installed. Uninstall the older ones!</p>
<p>Regarding Java 11 on windows I suggest to read this comment by Don Vip: <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/ticket/17048#comment:7.">https://josm.openstreetmap.de/ticket/17048#comment:7.</a> Unless you need <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/ticket/17048">highDPI support</a> in Windows it seems that currently the simplest way is to stick with the latest Java 8 supplied <a href="https://java.com">by Oracle</a>.</p>
<p>(I did not try anything of the previous since I use Linux - with a openjdk 11 JRE)</p>
