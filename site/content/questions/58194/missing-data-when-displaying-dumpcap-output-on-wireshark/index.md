Input data rate is approximately 70KB/sec. The packet protocol is rather simple - a single byte of command (identifying the log source), a 16-bit byte count followed by some number of bytes of data. This is being sent over a Bulk Endpoint connection and byte counts are exactly 0x3000 for one log source and anywhere in the range 0x200-0x230 for the other. On the Pi I am using the command "dumpcap -i 8 -b filesize:10000 -b files:20 -w /mnt/Tap/logServer/LOGs/Wireshark/capt.pcap" to create a rolling list of 20 10MB files before the oldest is overwritten. When I compare the Wireshark display of a pcap file to the binary file of logged data, I'm seeing the first 32 bytes of data following the protocol header, followed by 96 bytes of data that shows up in the log file but not on the Wireshark display. This repeats through the end of each log packet - 32 bytes displayed, 96 bytes missing. I have checked dozens of packets and it's never more or less - always the same 32/96 mix. While I've used Wireshark for a number of years, I am relatively new to using it for USB and I am very new to using dumpcap, so I suspect I have something messed up in the configuration. I've been through the dumpcap manpage but don't see anything that might lead to what I'm seeing.</p><p>I'd be grateful if anyone has any ideas on what I'm doing wrong.</p><p>Thanks, Dave</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">dumpcap usbmon usb</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>17 Dec '16, 11:36</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7deed2ab3c5a75d2a421b07804baa5d0?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="DaveHarper&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>DaveHarper<br />

I'm basically a hardware guy trying to use to the tools to track down an issue that occurs every few days or so. Any tips on how to determine what to check next? The dumpcap application is running under a Debian version of Linux on the Raspberry Pi and I need to run the command "modprobe usbmon" to be able to run the tools. Is "usbmon" the capture library you're referring to? Unfortunately, I'm pretty ignorant of what is actually happening "under the covers" so I don't really know where to start. While I will likely eventually capture what I need to track down my problem, that might not be the case for someone else. So I'd like to do what I can to help resolve things, especially since I seem to have a repeatable test case that shows the problem.</p></div><div id="comment-58232-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(19 Dec '16, 08:54)</span> DaveHarper</div></div><span id="58233"></span><div id="comment-58233" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-58233-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>We're at the stage now where I only know enough about Linux capturing and usb capturing to be dangerous, not helpful.</p><p>Hopefully someone else might chip in.</p></div><div id="comment-58233-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(19 Dec '16, 10:14)</span> grahamb ♦</div></div><span id="58237"></span><div id="comment-58237" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-58237-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>Any tips on how to determine what to check next?

It captures atop many different capture mechanisms, including Linux's "usbmon" USB traffic capture mechanism; "usbmon" is a Linux kernel module.</p><p>If a Linux USB capture is chopping off packet data at 96 bytes or so, that might be because only the "text mode" usbmon mechanism is working. What is the version of the kernel on the Raspberry Pi? If it's older than 2.6.21, the kernel doesn't support the "binary mode" usbmon mechanism, and you won't be able to get the full data.
