Yes, Wireshark (and similar tools) are very useful even if you cannot read the payload. However, based on personal experience, a lot of problems are within the client/server communication (at the application layer) and you won't be able to diagnose those problems with more encryption in place (if that happens anyway).</p><blockquote><p>Those who control end points can still use Wireshark the same way by instrumenting their applications to save either the keying material or plaintext.</p></blockquote><p>Besides <strong>some</strong> browsers, which client application do you know that dumps session keys? I know virtually none.</p><p>So, this will be a bigger problem than it is already today. Sure, some applications can be configured/tricked to accept a intermediate certificate of an SSL proxy. But, it's a hassle today and it will get worse with more encryption in place.</p><blockquote><p>I think the future for network tools are traffic and flow analysis.</p></blockquote><p>That's also what I think. So, there should be good tools available for that special purpose. I know there are good commercial tools already available, but I don't know (yet) a good open source tool for it. Should that kind of functionality be part of Wireshark?</p><blockquote><p>Network zones containing the most important assets will probably be under "Network Security Monitoring" tools such as those included in the Security Onion distro.</p></blockquote><p>ACK</p></div><div id="comment-23877-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(20 Aug '13, 08:17)</span> Kurt Knochner ♦</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-23846" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-23846-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

In such environments, there isn't much motivation for encryption. Encryption of important/sensitive data over a WAN or Internet is already best-practice and very common for enterprises.</p></li><li><p>In many cases with Wireshark you're troubleshooting at layers before encryption occurs. In such cases, the encryption makes no difference.</p></li><li><p>Unless there's a need for a drastic change, and unless businesses/application developers see that need clear as day, it's going to take a long time for end-to-end encryption of common applications that need troubleshooting to ever see the light of day. IPv6 and VoIP are great examples of technology which are superior to what we have now, but not so much so to justify an overhaul so the changes have come very, very slowly.</p></li></ul><p>For the problem of bandwidth and network usage increasing, a few other thoughts:</p><ul><li><p>Network architecture in the mobile/telecom space has taken a lot of steps over the last few 3GPP releases to isolate control/signaling traffic (the stuff you'd likely want to troubleshoot with) from the simpler, high-bandwidth user-plane data flows, logically and in most cases physically on the wire. This approach allows for the capture of signaling traffic relevant for sessions that could be carrying Tbps's of bandwidth by capturing on very low-bandwidth links.</p></li><li><p>The traffic capturing and aggregation/filtering/sorting technologies out there are keeping up with increased bandwidth pretty well. The quick rise of companies like VSS who sell dedicated aggregators for filtering high-bandwidth links into isolate flows for analysis, the move of vendors like Cisco to performing SPAN on their routing platforms in hardware rather than the historically processor-crippling methods they'd used in the past, the advancement of new in-line capture methods such as JDSU's Packet Portal (SFPs in a router or switch that can intelligently self-mirror traffic to an analyzer), off the top of my head are just a few examples of the market rising to meet these kinds of challenges.</p></li></ul><p>For clouds, all I'll say on that is that it creates a few unknowns in your troubleshooting. That's almost always a reality, and would require you to call the cloud's operator for assistance possibly. No different than troubleshooting a roaming scenario in mobile.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>31 Aug '13, 19:48</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f533c5f20f9c9afbf4b03de08a100e11?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Quadratic&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Quadratic<br />

If that creates a problem for network troubleshooting depends on the protocols used, the applications and many more factors. However, I tend to believe that it will make quite a few thing more complicated. Even today I often have problems to get the server keys for TLS decryption, due to incompetence, security issues, etc. With DHE ciphers it's even harder, unless you have a client that reveals the sessions keys (not that often in the wild). With more encryption in place (which is good!) it will get even harder.</p><p>Regarding network usage and bandwidth: Yes, there are already good commercial (hardware) solutions that are able to filter and/or store capture data at high speeds. But what about open source tools like Wireshark? Will they be able to compete in that field, or do they need new, unique features (like more automatic 'expert analysis modules', automatic flow analaysis, etc.) to be able to still deliver a good value for users in the future?</p></div><div id="comment-24296-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 Sep '13, 00:08)</span> Kurt Knochner ♦</div></div><span id="24318"></span><div id="comment-24318" class="comment"><div id="post-24318-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I view Wireshark as a receiver, or user of those kinds of network capturing technologies rather than as a competitor. Those tools specialize in filtering or sorting flows out of high-capacity links and forwarding the right flows to the right analyzers. They do filtering at very low layers, typically no higher than L4, relying on analyzers (Wireshark, Snort, etc.) to receive the smaller flows to do deeper dives on them.</p><p>One area that the open source community still needs to fill, whether as an evolution of Wireshark or as something else, is flow analysis and performance management counters built at that deeper level. Right now we have people digging into Lua or perl/tshark scripting, calling Wireshark dissectors to build application-level counters for all sorts of metrics that no open-source tool other than Wireshark can dissect. When I see the same or similar task being tackled independantly by all sorts of people in the industry (the task of automating packet captures and scanning through time intervals for a count or averaging of a given value of a given field of a given protocol that only Wireshark can decode or count, for the purpose of reporting), it speaks to a need for a new tool or a revisioning of Wireshark's scope as an ad-hoc, session-level analyzer.</p><p>So in short, Wireshark is the microscope for a session, dedicated capture/filter/aggregator tools on high capacity links are the birds-eye view that can feed the microscope something to start looking at, but there's something missing in between for analysing application-level flows for the purpose of performance management and reporting.</p></div><div id="comment-24318-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 Sep '13, 15:43)</span> Quadratic</div></div><span id="24330"></span><div id="comment-24330" class="comment"><div id="post-24330-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>One area that the open source community still needs to fill, whether as an evolution of Wireshark or as something else, is flow analysis and performance management counters built at that deeper level.</p></blockquote><p>Yep, that's what I'm missing as well.</p><blockquote><p>it speaks to a need for a new tool or a revisioning of Wireshark's scope as an ad-hoc, session-level analyzer.</p></blockquote><p>I agree, that (real-time) monitoring features within Wireshark would be interesting for some people.</p></div><div id="comment-24330-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 Sep '13, 23:47)</span> Kurt Knochner ♦</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-24252" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-24252-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

A better idea would be to steal some secrets documents and publish them. That would really pi.. them off. I hope nobody plans to do such a thing in the near future!!</p><blockquote><p>I honestly think encryption will only make them think you have something to hide.</p></blockquote><p>Well, the only use of encryption <strong>is</strong> to hide something and if the wish to hide something is suspicious in itself, we should all have glass walls in our homes. After all: If you don't have to hide something .... ;-)</p><blockquote><p>but an <strong>encrypted connection that stands out</strong> might very well make the analysts hope to catch someone important to get promoted.</p></blockquote><p>How does one encrypted connection stand out more than another, if it is not terminating in the Al-Qaeda headquarters?</p><blockquote><p>Make yourself as boring as possible.</p></blockquote><p>That's not a very clever advice, because that's the tactics of sleeper agents.

I define all communications through what I see normally. It's like seeing a stranger. Google, Akamai, and FaceBook all have predictable protocols that they "like" using. They respond to new webpages the same, and when they change, it's usually something I'd have honestly expected sooner. (like the transfer to https by facebook)</p><p>All I can say about book ciphers is that I've met a lot of crypto-nerds over the years, and I know a few people who'd rather not have their vices tracked, or used against them later in court. The idea isn't to be so secure as unnoticed. They work.</p><p>The AISRC stuff could have been to scare me away, but I hadn't heard about the Iran nuclear hack yet though, and it was the w3af that I read later was also used there.<br />
</p><p>Who cares? My point was that there is security in being unnoticed. You can't hack, crack, or spoof being invisible in a crowd because it seems like you're talking about food on twitter.<br />
