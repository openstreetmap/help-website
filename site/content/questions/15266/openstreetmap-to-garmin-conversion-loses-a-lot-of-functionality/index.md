<p>This is most likely not an OSM issue, but a Garmin issue.</p>
<p>Garmin has always refused to tell us how their files are build up. Some developers have found ways to make Garmin files from OSM data, but these are far from good.</p>
<p>There are ways to get routing into the maps though. But that depends on who compiled the Garmin files. Can you tell us where you got those files?</p>

<p>The nüvi seems to be mostly untested. you can report it to the website owner that you model doesn't work good with it, and meanwhile, you can also install some maps from <a href="http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl/">http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl/</a> although they ars mare general (the whole world is compiled), they are also tested for more devices.</p>
