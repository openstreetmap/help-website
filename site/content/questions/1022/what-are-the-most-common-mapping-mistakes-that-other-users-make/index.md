<p>The <em>most common</em> mistake users make, is to register for OpenStreetMap, but then fail to do any map editing at all. Strange but true! <a href="http://neis-one.org/2010/08/20/%E2%80%9Enominal-members%E2%80%9C-of-osm/">See pascal's „Nominal Members“ of OSM? blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Please all you people. Have a go at mapping! Make mistakes. We don't mind.</p>

<p>Absolutely Harry. I'm keeping a careful eye on this post because I definitely don't want it to turn into a set of "slag off the noobs" answers. I'm interested in finding where the common problems are so we can help the noobs (and everyone else).</p>

<p>As a new user who's registered but not (yet) edited the map, I'll suggest that some sort of introduction to editing the map is desperately needed. Or if there is one, it needs to be much more prominent; I found my way to this "help centre" looking for such a guide, and still haven't found one. I'll be glad to have a go at mapping once I figure out how!</p>

<p>I'm not surprised that MANY people sign up then give up. The instructions and answers are spread over many different systems and I haven't found answers to some pretty basic questions yet. I had to create a second login to post this comment and more logins are required to participate in discussion groups. I tried watching a video, but it's just too large for my rural connection. I am very discouraged at this point. I edited databases from '75 to '88 and continued with systems design work until '01 but I'm not sure that I can find out how to help here.</p>

<p>Absolutely agreed re "The instructions and answers are spread over many different systems". While things are getting better (this help site didn't exist when I started, for example) there's still a long way to go.</p>
<p>One of the places that I'd suggest asking "what's it all about then" questions is the "<a href="http://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/newbies">newbies</a>" list. It's relatively low traffic, so if you subscribe you won't get swamped.<br />
</p>
<p>Another is the "#OSM" <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/IRC">IRC channel</a>. There's a wide range of different discussions in there at any one time but if you ask a question like "how do I do X?" or "I've just mapped Y, does it look OK?" someone will usually be around to reply (if you don't have an IRC client installed you can just use the <a href="http://irc.openstreetmap.org/">web client</a>).</p>
<p>There are also various diferent discussion groups within the <a href="http://forum.openstreetmap.org/">forum</a>, and for a general "contact" overview see <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contact">this</a> page.</p>

<p>Go mapping!</p>
<p>Yes, but don't map ignoring the licence and contributor terms. Mapping from Google is wrong but there are lots of allowed sources (including the Bing imagery covering the world by satellite in medium resolution, plus US and most of Europe in high resolution Aerial orthophotography). But let's not forget that Bing imagery is frequently old (often more than 5 years, and even the last monthly updates in Bing are photos dating almost one year). But DON'T REMOVE data you don't understand or that you don't like rendered because it's "ugly" for your eyes or invisible in Bing images!</p>

<p>Another reason for people not feeling brave enough to start is that the default editor which comes up when I click 'Edit' is Potlatch 2, but the online tutorial I was sent a link to when I signed up shows a different or older editor, bearing little visual resemblance to Potlatch 2. Also, no warning was given that the Bing imagery is not necessarily exactly aligned. I merrily set to work adjusting local buildings and roads by 2 or 3 metres wondering why so many were a bit out.</p>

<p>I'm a newbie. I'll say that although there is definitely available documentation it is very confusing to have docs for iD, P2, JSOM all mixed together. Also, I didn't find any that are comprehensive from a beginners perspective, they include how to add a POI but tagging that POI is covered in a very high level gloss. For example, I am trying to figure out (please don't feel the need to answer here, I've already asked in the forum...) how to add a golf=driving_range tag but can't to find specifics. iD only offers me some of the tag options and I'm not sure where to put it in P2 or JOSM.</p>

<p>Hello, I registered today since I am using OSM heavily on my ANDROID phone during my trip in Japan and intend to contribute. Looking for a tutorial, I came here. Here a good tutorial on creating OSM maps: <a href="/questions/28251/interactive-tutorial-to-getting-started-editing-osm">https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/28251/interactive-tutorial-to-getting-started-editing-osm</a> including the following links: <a href="http://learnosm.org/en/">http://learnosm.org/en/</a> <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide</a> This should save you at least 30 minutes of searching around for tutorials, beginners guides, OSM basics, etc.....</p>

<h1 id="unconnected-ways">Unconnected Ways</h1>
<p><img src="/upfiles/osm_broken_junction.PNG" alt="Screengrab from Potlatch editor showing unconnected ways" /></p>
<p>The selected way is a residential street that should clearly form a junction with the "Langdon Road" way at the bottom of the image. But as you can see, there is no black box around that point, so the original OSMer has actually missed and the result is that the way stops just before it gets to "Langdon Road".</p>
<p>I see this mistake a lot (which is what prompted me to ask the question). It is barely noticeable when just viewing the map, but it really messes up routing through these streets and I usually find errors like these when investigating <a href="http://www.skobbler.co.uk/osmbugs">reported map bugs from skobbler</a></p>

<p>Indeed unconnected ways are a fairly common issue despite both potlatch and josm indicating quite well when a way is connected and when not.</p>
<p>One tool to help find and fix these errors is the OSM inspector - routing view. ( <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=routing&amp;lon=-0.02490&amp;lat=51.36767&amp;zoom=6">http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=routing&amp;lon=-0.02490&amp;lat=51.36767&amp;zoom=6</a> ). But as with all automated tools, it also has a number of false positives / negatives, so it can't be used blindly to fix these.</p>

<p>OpenStreetMap.fr has also developed an excellent QA tool (<strong>Osmose</strong>) that covers now the world, with <strong>live updates</strong>. Compared to KeepRight, it is often much more precise, more detailed, with useful fixes proposed, at least for Europe and its dependencies on other continents (except possibly Asia), and it is fresher (better fix things sooner than later and give help to the author, to avoid other problems). But unconnected ways, and unclosed boundaries ARE detected everywhere. Additionally, this tool speaks YOUR language (KeepRight just speaks English or has poor translations).</p>

<p>The easiest fix in JOSM is to start dragging the ending node, then presssing CTRL while dropping the node to the other way to join with it. Note how the mouse cursor changes when you're pressing CTRL while still dragging the node... pressing 'J' with the node selected sometimes moves it and connect it to the wrong nearby way. Another solution: press CTRL to create the intersection node on the way, add the other node to the selection and press 'M' to merge the nodes (but this will move the newest node to the oldest one, so a straight way would become non straight)</p>

<p>Also, when you see unconnected roads, you may just move back the final node up to the point where there's a pedestrian crossing. Add the crossing tag, the stop marks for vehicles, Then select that node and use the line mode to terminate the way to the crossing point. Finally add turn restriction on this new final node.</p>

<p>In general I'd say this is not so much a "common mapping mistake" but more of a thing we'd like new users to "graduate" onto doing, once they're getting the hang of editing. I don't think it should be regarded as essential, or rude not to. I do always try to add a good comment. Techy people are very fastidious about this kind of thing, but it might take some new users a while to pick up the habit, and that's fine.</p>
<p>@miriotomo yes. I make the same mistake quite a lot when dipping into Potlatch editing. I know about the 'c' button, but tend to save by mistake expecting to be asked (like in JOSM)</p>

<h1 id="highway-classification">Highway Classification</h1>
<p>A common error from newbies is the highway classification.<br />
For instance, a <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dsecondary">highway=secondary</a> is downgraded to a residential road (<em><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dresidential">highway=residential</a></em>) just because it's crossing a village and/or is temporarily narrower. The highway classification primary/secondary/tertiary/unclassified/residential is indicating the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/Highway_key_voting_importance">importance</a> of a road within the transportation network. This may or may not affect the physical attributes (in fact, they are: a primary road is usually wider than a residential road). But physical attributes have to be documented with other tags (like <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:width">width</a>, <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Surface">surface</a>, <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:lanes">lanes</a>, etc).<br />
Another mistake is to use <em>highway=unclassified</em> when the highway class is unknown (e.g. traced from aerial imagery) where the correct tag is <em>highway=road</em>.<br />
But it's also true that for some roads, setting the right highway class is not easy, especially in countries where the OSM highway classes don't have a 1:1 equivalence with the local administrative classifications.</p>

<p>You can see this quite often in Italy: highest highway class in urban centres (sometimes quite big ones with place=city) is tertiary or unclassified.

<p>That's a good one! I only recently started converting some of the streets that I (and others) had tagged as tertiary to unclassified. I had completely misread originally what unclassified meant. And I do live in one of those countries, for which this classification means little. I don't know if this is cheating, but when in doubt I peek at Google Maps. They only have two colors: white and yellow. I have decided that Google's yellow covers our primary, secondary and tertiary. If a road is not yellow in Google, I tend not to tag it higher than unclassified. Or is that another mistake? ;)</p>

<p><strong>Aerial imagery offset</strong></p>
<p>In my area almost all new users don’t know about aerial imagery (Bing) offset. So they start drawing new objects without offset imagery at all. Sometimes even worst, they start moving old objects. Then I have to communicate them and revert or fix their edits. And True_Offset will not really helpful, because it change to frequently in hill area. From my point of view we have to keep remind new users of any editors necessity to adjust imagery. Maybe we can keep mark in database for users who confirm that he knows about offset.</p>

<p>Quite often in OSM, we find two roads (or road/railway or road/waterway) crossing in OSM without any information about the intersection. Thus we don't know if it is really an intersection (<em>simply put a node</em>) or if it is crossing at different levels (<em>don't put a node but split the way to extract a small segment and tag it with 'bridge=yes' and 'layer=1'</em>) (or 'tunnel=yes' if it is a tunnel).<br />
Even if you don't know exactly where the bridge/tunnel is starting/finishing, it's better to have approximate length than leaving a question mark on the map (because it's reported by almost all <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Quality_Assurance">quality assurance tools</a> and cannot be fixed without a second survey). And please, don't put a node if both ways are at different layers even if you tag them correctly, otherwise some routing application might think that the link exists (e.g. steps) and might create routes through some connections that do not exist in reality.</p>

<p>I've more then once found where people who look at the quality assurance tools think they can fix this without a second survey. They draw a bridge where there is no bridge in the real world. This is really irritating, because it replaces a very visible error with an error that is hard to find.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that this is is partially because the Potlatch 2 "simple" interface has field called "name" for most features, and it's tempting to fill it in with something like e.g. "Public Footpath".</p>
<p>Similarly, there are lots of ways with <a href="http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/oneway=no">oneway=no</a> set. In some cases this might be necessary, but in many I suspect it's a case of "filling in all the fields".</p>

<p>Not adapting the quantity of nodes for highways to the situation. Often mappers use always the same (regular) distance between 2 nodes of a way, more or less regardless if it is straight or curved. Instead you should put more nodes in straight curves and only 1 node on each end of a non-curved part of a way (unless there are junctions or changing attributes like maxspeed in between).</p>

<p>All those unneeded nodes make the database a lot bigger without even adding a single bit of detail (sometimes, making it even harder to align the road better, or introducing curves where there are none).</p>
<p>So I agree with this one, straight ends don't need nodes, and those nodes should be deleted when editing a way.</p>

<p>Note however that straight highway are not really straight above some distance (almost never for streets in cities at distances higher than 50 meters: you need additional nodes for changes of lanes, parking lots, turning lanes, and trafic calming reduction of widths; even for motorways in rural areas, the line is not straight above about 200 meters. Placing nodes correctly at reasonnable distance improves the precision and avoids making deviation angles visible when there's effectively a very clight curve. As a rule place the nodes as exactly as possible in the middle of the road on the visible painted signals between the two directions, and avoid this line to cross more than a single lane or getting out of the road (through side drains or though kerbs separating side walkways or through security barriers.)</p>

<p>yes, you will need more nodes for detailed mapped features even if they consist of straight lines, because of changing properties and intersecting ways. As a rule of thumb, when mapping highways in "significantly incomplete" areas, you can put a node on each intersection, even if you don't add the crossing highways at that time.</p>

<p>Additionnaly to other mentioned common error, another one is data without source mentionned. When I see strange data without source, I cannot evaluate the error of the autor (error of the GPS, obsolete imagery, approximate survey, …) and the final solution is to ask to the author. An other consequence is that we cannot evaluate easily the quality of the data, depending of the known lack of precision of a source.</p>

<p>I don't know exactly what kind of strange data you are referring to, but if there is a way (tagged highway) in OSM which is not there in reality you should correct it regardless of the source. Source is useful for stuff like "population" where you can see how old the data is.</p>

<p>I wish Potlatch2 gave better tools for adding source easily. For example: similarly to how R replicates all tags from the last touched object of the same class (which is awesome), so S or Ctrl-R or some hotkey should replicate just the last entered source.</p>
