<p>There might be imports but given how buildings and addresses have appeared in this area I think it is mainly a matter of where the local mappers are and what their focus is. For example, I've done lots of houses and addresses in Sunnyvale but other than correcting a few speed limits have done little in Los Altos. If/when I ever get my part of Sunnyvale done I might work west and get the southern part of Mountain View and Los Altos. Or maybe not.</p>
<p>I don't know how others do it but I find I pretty much have to walk each street to get the address numbers: Driving or bicycling I end up with only address ranges as I am moving too fast to get all the individual house numbers. So for me to gather the house numbers for a neighborhood I need to find reasonably close public parking then walk to the neighborhood and in some residential areas that can be quite a distance.</p>
<p>If your local neighborhood doesn't have house outlines or addresses, join in the fun. It can be time consuming but isn't all that hard.</p>

<p>In practical terms I've never been able to decipher a house number with 1080P recordings other than in closeups. It might be slightly better with 4K but I doubt it. Which leaves pointing a still camera (or a couple to cover 360°) at the houses, which in a number of regions of the world tends not to go down all too well.</p>

<p>I've been questioned by the local law enforcement about what I was doing having simply walked the streets with a clipboard writing down numbers, so I'd guess taking a photo of each house would not go down well either. I find that pressing the audio record button on OSMTracker and speaking the number (and using the hands free microphone) as I walk by makes me innocuous. Everyone is used to people talking to themselves on the phone nowadays.</p>
