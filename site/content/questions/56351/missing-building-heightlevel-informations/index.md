<p>If not for this purpose can we have some kind of area tags as dense to sparse/high to low in gradient so that we can get a general height information.</p>

<p>The reason why people rarely enter building heights or levels is that many buildings are drawn from aerial imagery where you can't see how high the building is.</p>
<p>A general fuzzy area height information is probably not a good match with OSM, but you can of course get third-party DEM data and mix that with OSM to achieve the desired result. In some areas such data is even available as open data.</p>

<p>Yes the reason is very obvious. The problem is using some public DEM data will not fix the missing height information in OSM database.</p>

<p>Hi Europa, there seems to be one other way. Since OSM depends on the mapper / volunteers for the data go out and make a survey in your own area and start enlarging the area bit by bit steadily :-)</p>

<p>So.</p>
<p>I'd LOVE to do this for my local university campus.</p>
<p>The university does not publish the height (either in feet or stories) but does publish photographs, and I can count.</p>
<p>However, the very first building I tried did not have a "Levels" field, although subsequent ones did, and no clear way for me to add it.</p>
<p>Brand new to OSM editing. Can someone give a pointer maybe?</p>

<p>in iD (the editor in the browser), open the "All tags" section, press + , type "level" in the left side, type the number of levels in the right box. Done.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that "<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:level">level</a>" indicates the floor on which the tagged object is located (e.g. an office on the second floor/level). If you want to indicate the number of floors in a building, the tag would be "<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building:levels">building:levels</a>".</p>

<p>But I wasn't asking a "new" question: I was asking a "related" question, in an attempt to elicit information that would make this thread more valuable for people who come upon it as the result of a search. I fail, completely, to see how asking for more detail makes for a poorer product.</p>
<p>BTW, does anyone know where I can rent an elephant cooler? Now, that's a new question--for which I apologize.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/13802/dopensm">@dopensm</a>: Unfortunately the "question and answer" format here doesn't really handle discussion well - it's limited to "questions", "answers" and "comments". If I ask related questions I usually link both the original and new questions via comments - that way people can see the answers and comments on each one separately, yet still know that both exist.</p>
<p>For some sorts of discussions though, another forum may be a better option, and where that is will depend on what the question is. For 3d stuff <a href="https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewforum.php?id=42">https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewforum.php?id=42</a> might be the best place, whereas for general "why do mappers not do X" or "how do I do X" one of the mailing lists <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mailing_lists">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mailing_lists</a> or IRC <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/IRC">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/IRC</a> might be better, and some non-English-language communities have most of their discussions in particular language forums <a href="https://forum.openstreetmap.org/index.php">https://forum.openstreetmap.org/index.php</a> . I'm sure it's frustrating to get an reply of "don't ask that here, ask over there" but it's beneficial in the long run because if you're asking a question you'll want the maximum number of people so see it.</p>
