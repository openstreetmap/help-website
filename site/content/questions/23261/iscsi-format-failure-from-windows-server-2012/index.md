</p><p>I've been working on an iSCSI server, mostly just for fun. Been chipping away at it in my spare time. I've managed to get through a lot of things. The Device is seen by Windows Server 2012. I can connect to it. I can initialize a disk. I can create partitions on the disk as far as I can tell (windows's own cache could be lying to itself about some of those things). But the actual formatting of the volume is where I run into trouble.<br />
</p><p>I've implemented all forms of ModeSense, ReadCapacity, Read, Write, Data-In, and Data-out. Also implemented a task-management class which seems to be functioning as intended.... but by golly, I just have no idea why this is still failing.</p><p>Some clues and relevant information:<br />
1) For starters, <a href="http://files.digitaltundra.com/iscsi-bad-format.pcapng">here's the capture</a></p><p>2) Windows Server 2012 Successfully completes the "Gather information" step and the "Create new partition" step, but during the "Format Volume" Step reports "Failed to format volume - One or more parameter values passed to the method were invalid."</p><p>3) The failure occurs immediately AFTER Packet Number 6384 which I verified with breakpoints.<br />
4) Packet 6384 is the longest Read operation during the process (128 blocks -- 65536 bytes).<br />
5) This Read operation follows a write operation to the same LBA of the same length (128 blocks -- 65536 bytes)<br />
6) The write operation is also the longest write operation of the entire process up to the point of failure. It is the first write operation to be &gt;= 128 blocks.<br />
7) There are other multi-block read and write operations that do not return errors, which to the best of my knowledge point the finger away from the Task-management system. I'll try to briefly and succinctly describe how the task management system works<br />
7a).The long writes will send up to 8192 bytes in the first request, but the "Final" flag in the PDU will NOT be set.<br />
7b). The Absense of the "Final" flag causes a task to be registered in a list, indexed by the "InitiatorTaskTag"<br />
7c). "DataOut" PDUs follow the Write request and reference the InitiatorTAskTag which keeps information about the origin of the write request. The data-out packets are written using an offset of the original Task.<br />
7d). If the DataOut packet has the "Final" flag set, the task is cleared at the end of its operation.<br />
<br />
</p><p>All of that internal stuff kinda seems to be working, but the format still fails. I've been looking at this problem for quite some time and I'm out of ideas and will need to shelve it for a while. Unfortunately, I think that any one of these 6000+ packets could potentially be causing the problem. I wish windows would just tell me WHICH parameter is incorrect.<br />

My current issue is as big of a pain in the butt as my previous issue. Part of my problem is that I cannot find any sample captures that show Read() operations that exceed the MaxRecvDataLength value negotiated during login. It kinda seems like that for some reason my login negotiation is being ignored by the client, even though it matches the sample I used practically byte for byte. When talking to the Target that I reverse engineered, the client never requests more than 128 blocks of data per read (65536 bytes) which also matches the MacRecvDataLength negotiated during login. However, when talking to MY target, it will request up to 256 blocks, and my response to this request causes the client to reset the connection with no warnings or messages logged. I respond with Data-In followed by Data-In with the Final bit set. (2 PDUs). Maybe I need to try 3 PDUs sending a separate PDU for the status.... I dunno... running out of ideas.</p></div><div id="comment-23366-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(25 Jul '13, 11:34)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">ev1lr0b0t</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-23337" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-23337-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

This packet is ACKed in the next frame. However, then the 'server' (172.16.0.33) does not react for 119 seconds!! Then it ACKs a packet that is not in the capture file (see frame 6387). This is totally different to previous behavior in the capture file. If we can assume that the capture file is complete (<strong>can we?</strong>), there seems to be a bug in the iSCSI server implementation. However, I don't think you will find the reason for the problem just by looking at the capture file, as neither the inactivity for 119 seconds can be explained with the observed behavior in the capture file nor the ACK for an unseen packet.</p><p>Regards<br />

Since there is no SCSI layer error recovery I am guessing the frame was not sent. Unless there was some type of iSCSI protocol error in the frame - then it would be normal of the initiator to close the TCP connection provided that the 2 devices were operating at error recovery level 0.</p><p>NOT the iSCSI standard requires devices that only support error level 0 to close the connection when a protocol error is encountered.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>14 Nov '16, 04:48</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b2d0183529e31bcca9461e7348206c16?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="LouD&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>LouD</span><br />
