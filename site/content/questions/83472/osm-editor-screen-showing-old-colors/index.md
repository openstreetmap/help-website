<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I would like to know why my OSM editing map shows hiking trails with colors that have been deleted in the tags a while ago? Here is a link to an example of mine. The green colored trail markings are long gone replaced with a current red color, and yet green is what shows up on the OSM editor. Why? And can I fix it so that I don't see old stuff. And yes, I have already turned off the past/future map feature.</p>

<p>Hi, could you link directly to one of these trails, or give the id number of the way or relation? I'm not sure I am looking at the right thing - I only see the usual ID colours for the type of object e.g. highway=track.</p>
<p>Also, are you tagging the colour on the route relation or the underlying way?</p>

<p>Thanks for both your comments! Here are the responses.</p>
<p>1) I am tagging the colour (colour=red) of the way AND also the relation (osmc:symbol=red:white:red_stripe). This is the link to what is now a red way but still showing green on the screen of my editor: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#map=16/32.2522/34.8574">https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#map=16/32.2522/34.8574</a></p>
<p>2) How do I attach a screenshot to a "comment"? Send it as an answer to my own question?</p>
<p>Thank you, guys!</p>

<p>Your screenshot arrived correctly in my email notification although it seems to have disappeared here.</p>
<p>Having seen the screenshot, I believe you are talking about the background imagery/tiles, rather than the editable data layer - possibly the "Israel Hiking" background. In that case, what you see in the editor will depend on the update frequency of those tiles, and also how frequently ID updates from that source. I have no idea of the update frequency, but it's no surprise that there could be a delay in seeing changes - the editable layer is "live" but it would be impossible to update the backgrounds in real time.</p>
<p>(I am a bit surprised at the use of the colour= tag on a way (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/288069064)">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/288069064)</a> to refer to the colour of hiking waymarks. I have worked on quite a few hiking routes in OSM and where a colour is mapped I have always seen it on the hiking route relation, not the ways that make it up. It is not clear to me how a data consumer would know that "colour=" on a highway=track refers to hiking symbols, whereas it has a defined and documented meaning on a route relation. But it seems to be an understood convention in your area).</p>

<p>Hi. Thank you for your answer. I am new to mapping and new to this forum. I sent the picture via "Your answer" and then thought I have to respond to you via "add new comment". So, I erased the "answer" which allows pictures to be attached and then sent "add new comment" which does not allow pictures. Question: When do I use "add new comment" and when do I use "Your answer"?</p>
<p>Israel Hiking Maps has its own usage criteria and I try to conform to them. In this environment, the relation adds a trail number in the color of the hiking/biking trail to the way. In the way itself, "colour=" gives color to the way itself. This is their convention. Are you telling me that the leftover color of the trails on the OSM map is leftover from Israel Hiking Maps?</p>

<p>I also find this forum quite tricky at times, I think the best way is probably to edit your original question, I think that will allow you to add a screenshot.</p>
<p>"Are you telling me that the leftover color of the trails on the OSM map is leftover from Israel Hiking Maps?" I'm not sure what you mean by "OSM map" here. Perhaps you are confusing the "map data" (the actual OSM objects that you can edit and that will immediately reflect your edits) with the "background", static tiles that can be used to guide your edits but do not change in real time. If you change the background to something else e.g. Bing, or even to "None", does that help answer your question?</p>

<p>Hi Alan, Wow, you are good! You got me thinking. Apparently, what you wrote: “the "background”, static tiles that can be used to guide your edits but do not change in real time” IS what I am seeing and upon further investigation, I see that this group Israel Hiking Trails controls what we see when we enter OSM. On their map, there is a button we press to enter into OSM. I did an experiment. I pressed the OSM button and once inside OSM, I changed the OSM background to something else ["OpenStreetMap (Standard)", and all the trail colors disappeared from the map]. I closed OSM and then pressed the OSM button again. When I came back in, the OSM background was changed back to what it always seems to be whenever I enter - “Custom”. Clicking on "Custom" reveals a whole lot of customization commands (which I do not understand and for the time being do not need to understand). Therefore, I am now NOT surprised that they are responsible for the lingering old background. I will be in touch with them directly to get their response. I thank you very much for being so helpful! Respectfully, Yitzchak</p>

<p>Ok it all makes more sense now, I didn't realise you were accessing OSM in a way that is quite different from the typical "new user" experience, I can see how that could be confusing and perhaps blurs the distinction between the raw OSM data and the Israel Hiking map which is only one of thousands of maps derived from that data. I think it might be worth your while to try the "vanilla" OSM editor, entering directly from the openstreetmap.org home page. Also you might be interested in hiking.waymarkedtrails.org which is used by mappers worldwide to visualize hiking routes.</p>

<p>First off, you answered a question I had: How can I directly access the OSM editor. Wow, you are chock full of information for me. I got lucky and stumbled into the right guy! And yes, I will check out that link. Again, thank you so much! P.S. Only thousands? I've been telling my wife: millions.... :-)</p>
