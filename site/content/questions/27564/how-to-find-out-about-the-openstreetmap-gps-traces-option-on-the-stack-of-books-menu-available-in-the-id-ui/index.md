<p>No - it's one question, perhaps best summarised as "how do I find out about the 'OpenStreetMap GPS Traces' option on the 'stack of books' menu available in the iD UI".</p>

<p>I can only answer parts of your question(s):</p>
<p><em>Which traces are shown?</em><br />
Shown are "Identifiable" as well as "Public" traces.</p>
<p><em>What do the colours mean?</em><br />
The colour indicates the direction of travel. It can be useful to identify oneways, dual carriageways. etc.</p>
<p><em>Is it possible (as it is with JOSM) to query traces to see which are old and which recent?</em><br />
No, this layer is just a static tile layer. So, no subsequent filtering is possible.</p>

<p>Thanks. It does seems a shame to have put a lot of effort into a blog post without that information actually being available from within the editor, where it's needed.</p>
<p>To summarise:</p>
<pre><code>Which traces are shown? The tooltip says &quot;Public&quot; - does this mean that &quot;Identifiable&quot; ones are not?</code></pre>
<p>Any GPS track uploaded and marked as "Identifiable" or "Public" is included in the layer.</p>
<pre><code>How long should it take for an uploaded trace to be visible?</code></pre>
<p>Allegedly "Every 60 seconds", although <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/SomeoneElse/traces/1590291">this</a> trace has been public for some hours now and doesn't appear. Presumably that's just another bug.</p>
<pre><code>What do the colours mean?</code></pre>
<p>Eastbound movement in red, westbound in cyan, northbound in yellow, and southbound in violet.</p>
<pre><code>Is it possible (as it is with JOSM) to query traces to see which are old and which recent?</code></pre>
<p>No</p>
<pre><code>Are waypoints displayed, and if so how?</code></pre>
<p>No idea yet.</p>
