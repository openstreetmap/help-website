<p>Re "what about a canal or basin they are also falsely defined as lake" we'd need to know what actual tags are you asking about, and it would also be helpful to know the actual location.</p>
<p>The name for Potlatch 2's preset for the tag "natural=water" is "lake", but realistically "natural=water" covers much more than just what in English would be termed a "lake".<br />
</p>
<p>Re "A stream and river have a limit at &lt; 3,00 m. " - whereabouts are you seeing that statement?</p>
