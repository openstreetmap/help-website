<p>Hello, new to this and can't figure something out. Maybe because I may not be describing the issue correctly.</p>
<p>Routing by any of the nine methods in the iD editor is incorrect to three houses at the tip of a cul-de-sac. Routing ends in a parking aisle behind a fence and covered parking structure from the houses (no way to get to the houses from where the route ends). This street has only one access point at a main road, so routing should go on that road to the end of the cul-de-sac.</p>
<p>I added the fence to the map, but it didn't fix this.</p>
<p>Hopefully this makes sense. I can provide specifics if needed.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and for any assistance.</p>

<p>This is almost certainly because the distance from the houses to the parking aisle is shorter than that from the top of the cul-de-sac. Unfortunately adding walls etc. won't help as these will not be considered by routing engines. Also routing problems often take several days to be updated, so you may already have done something which helps, but just aren't seeing it yet.</p>
<p>It would be best if you shared the location (you can do this privately via a message to another user from within OSM, my user name is the same as here) to help us get a better idea. Various ways to improve the situation may be possible, but without seeing the exact layout it's not possible to suggest anything particular.</p>

<p>SK53 is entirely correct. But if you want to dig into it without sharing the location, then here are some of the things I would be looking for:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Access tagging on the cul-de-sac. If "private" that could be a problem. A lot of private roads in my area really should be tagged with access=destination.</p></li>
<li><p>If the lots are big and the houses set back from the cul-de-sac then they may be closer to the parking aisle than the cul-de-sac. Adding driveways from the cul-de-sac to the houses may help.</p></li>
<li><p>It is likely the router is using the center of the house as its target. Some routers may know about building entrances so tagging the front door on the house outline might help.</p></li>
