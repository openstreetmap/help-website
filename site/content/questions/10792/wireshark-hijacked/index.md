Did you download the Wireshark binary from the official site (<a href="http://www.wireshark.org">www.wireshark.org</a>)? Just to be sure, upload your version of the installation package AND (at least) wireshark.exe to <a href="http://virustotal.com">virustotal.com</a>.</p><p>2.) Create a SHA1 checksum (NOT MD5!) - search google for tools - and post the checksum, including the exact version of your Wireshark installation package here.</p><p>3.) How do you know it was wireshark that openend the connections? Does your desktop firewall show wireshark.exe as the responsible process?</p><p>4.) What's the destination port (to 75.185.112.192) and what's in those packets (after all your running a sniffer ;-))</p><p>Regards<br />
