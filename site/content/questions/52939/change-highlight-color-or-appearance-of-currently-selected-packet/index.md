Either Gtk code (pre-2.0) or Qt code (post-2.0). How to actually achieve that is an exercise best left to the reader--it would take some research and that research would be best undertaken by the person actually interested in doing it.</p><p>And, no, there's no alternative coloring schemes. Wireshark doesn't support the concept of coloring schemes. There are a few color choices in the preferences and there are the coloring rules but that's it. Again, anything else will require you to write some code to achieve it.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>26 May '16, 14:58</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e0564001bb7deb960d5d9d9c1e0ba074?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="JeffMorriss&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>JeffMorriss ♦<br />
