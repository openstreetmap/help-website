<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm not affiliated with MySociety.org, but I admire their work and have subscribed to their newsletter. They've set up a new project which aims to get the public to submit information about "Assets of Community Value" (ACV). It looks like this will involve getting the public to submit potential ACVs, and importing lists maintained by local councils.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2018/06/11/introducing-keep-it-in-the-community/">https://www.mysociety.org/2018/06/11/introducing-keep-it-in-the-community/</a></p>
<p>ACVs might include Church Halls, Pubs, Libraries, etc. If an asset is an acknowledged ACV, that seems to mean that developers are restricted (in some way) from certain changes. Sorry to be vague.</p>
<p>It looks like the site they've created uses an OSM slippy map as a background, but that they're maintaining their own set of ACVs.</p>
<p>It would be better (in my view) if their submissions were properly added to OSM, with a tag that offers their ACV status.</p>
<p>Is there someone or some "official" OSM group who could reach out to MySociety to suggest ways their ACV data could be incorporated into OSM for mutual benefit?</p>

<p>The usual reason why we have never taken data from MySociety or similar pages (notably the post boxes <a href="http://dracos.co.uk/made/nearest-postbox/#">hosted</a> by Matthew Somerville) is that there is little guarantee that information comes from a source acceptable to the OpenStreetMap Terms and Conditions. In general people will just naturally use Google and Google StreetView either to find something or to place it on a map.</p>
<p>The way forward would be to encourage local authorities, which keep the registers of ACVs, to make this data available as open data. The model to follow would be that of Barry Cornelius at rowmaps. I know Adam Snape is <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-gb/2018-May/021489.html">doing sterling work</a> in this area to get more data open and to ensure that the licence information is as well documented as possible.</p>
