Us (the Vendor) have an IP address on each side both on the same subnet on an isolated VLAN. Pings from site A to site B are around 8ms consistently with no drops. Pings from site B to site A vary from 8ms to 750ms. When I run a 64 byte 1 packet ping every 5 seconds I see the 10 latest ping reply times of : 9ms, 9ms, 32ms, 14ms, 264ms, 13ms, 36ms, 19ms, 17ms, 254ms.</p><p>My natural reaction is to take a network trace. The issue is on the remote side (site B) there's only our equipment on the IP network. We don't have a tcptrace capability. I would also like to ping between other IP addresses at site A or site B, but the customer doesn't have any other IP addresses on this VLAN. If I don't have any other way to solve this I'm thinking I need to get the customer to assign an IP address to the VLAN on each side.</p><p>I'm looking for suggestions on what could be causing a longer ping time in one direction. I've doubled checked the speed/duplex settings on the interfaces and switch ports. We're not getting any dropped packets or other errors on the switch ports. I've checked the subnet masks. It's possible we have a duplicate IP address or bad arp entry. But it happens when I ping two different IP address on site A (from site B).</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">ping resonse time</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>07 Sep '12, 07:49</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a472d068843eefd8a4ef69c4f94e4160?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="gipper&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>gipper<br />

If you ping from site A to site B and response times are consistently around 8ms, then it tells me that the host at site B replying to those ping packets is able to service those packets in a timely &amp; consistent manner. To me, the problem appears to be with the host at site A. Perhaps it's overloaded? If you capture as close to the site A host as you can, you will eliminate the network latency and essentially capture the tier processing time of that host. I would recommend capturing on both sides to have the best picture though.</p></div><div id="comment-14121-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(07 Sep '12, 08:09)</span> cmaynard ♦♦</div></div><span id="14123"></span><div id="comment-14123" class="comment"><div id="post-14123-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>My natural reaction is to take a network trace.</p></blockquote><p>Did'nt you mention the IP address of Site A and B are in the same subnet?
