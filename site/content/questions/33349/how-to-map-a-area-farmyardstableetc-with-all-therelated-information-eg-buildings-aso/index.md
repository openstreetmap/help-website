<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've at the moment the following problem: I try to map a riding stable. I think the problem is more generally because farmyards have the same mapping problem. Maybe also for big industrial areas.</p>
<p>Whats also the content? The area is continues and contains different buildings.</p>
<ol>
<li>the residential house</li>
<li>some stable buildings</li>
<li>riding halls</li>
<li>riding sqares</li>
<li>paddocks</li>
<li>circles to move horses</li>

<li>huts</li>
<li>tracks</li>
<li>service ways</li>
<li>fences</li>
<li>gates</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>
<p>The wiki has to give different hints how to map a stable, but not how to do it in best practise so also the osm map will be shown in a good way and openroute service or openmaplink can use it.</p>
<p>What I think how to map it correctly in a good way? I feel to use a relation? What should the correact relation?</p>
<p>The situation: 1. one big area fenced to the real outer border (without gras lands). 2. I tag the area with name, address:housenumber, website amenity=stables, leisure=horse_riding, address:postcode. I think postcode can be removed. I related the area as house to a assosiatedStreet realtion. 3. I created at the entrance a point in the outer line of the area and give them the address:housenumber also (bad idea?) 4. I created for all buildings and places simple areas and tag them as described in wiki. I didn't use any address field at all here. All building and places are inside of the area.</p>
<p>Why I used address for the area: In germany not the house is the addresse, it's the area which contains the address.</p>
<p>I feel to use now a address realation to move all information which are generally to the whole area to the relation itself. Maybe also it is possible to use a poi object? Any other suggestion how to Or should I use the residential as the main item for all the stuff and try to relate all to this building? How to map the address:housenumber as the best only one time? questions over questions....</p>
<p>If a address item is not tagged (postcode, city) , how exatcly it is "calculated"? From residential area? assosiated street?</p>

<p>for the address calculation question: see <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/FAQ">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/FAQ</a></p>
<p>in short the following techniques are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>the area or boundary (e.g. postcode boundaries in Germany, or country boundaries) around the item</li>
<li>the nearest item (e..g. the street, a city node, a county node)</li>
<li>(partly) via the associatedStreet relation. With partly I mean: the street is picked from the associatedStreet relation (first street segment in the relation), the rest of the address is not taken from the associatedStreet relation</li>
</ul>
