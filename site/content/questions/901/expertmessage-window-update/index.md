The fact that windows are full just means that tcp can no longer send data (because the receiver's window is full).

If, however, you see a window full condition that is followed by numerous window zero conditions - ouch. Download the trace files at www.wiresharkbook.com/downloads. Open up the trace file called <code>http-download-bad.pcap</code> and look around packet 370. That is an ugly window zero condition. Now look at <code>http-download-good.pcap</code> - look at packet 374 (the sender says they only have 536 bytes of receive buffer space left - this causes the sender to wait as it has more than that amount of data queued up). About 2.75 seconds later though we see a window update showing there is more space available and the data transfer resumes nicely.</p><p>When you say the "Window size is at 65536 when a TCP window full is captured and packet length is at 1514" - note that the window full packet is from someone sending data. The window full condition is Wireshark's way of indicating that the data in this packet will fill the receive window of the target for that packet. It does not mean that the sender of that 1514 byte's has a window size issue (hence the fact that they have 65535 bytes in their window size field).</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>11 Nov '10, 16:58</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9b4bb3984350b45aee3eda5cc1c90d36?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="lchappell&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>lchappell ♦</span><br />
