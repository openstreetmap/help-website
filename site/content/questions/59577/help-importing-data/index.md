<p>I am trying to incorperate data my county has uploaded to arcgis into osm. My town, Schwenksville pa, is incomplete and in many areas completley incorrect. All of the information is public knowledge and not copywrited.</p>
<p>The issues that I am encountering are the inability to export the geojson file or at least understand the query output to enter the coordinates manually. I do not have a computer I use my android phone, ipad, surface rt, and a tomtom to confirm physical data.</p>
<p>I am requesting assistance in how to put the data in myself. If my devices do not allow that I humbley request someone import it for me. The most important are the local, municipal, and state parks for now. Here is a link to the data.</p>

<p>Thank you for any insight the community can lend. I look forward to learning more as I continue to recover from a head injury recieved in a car accident last year. Transfering my hobby of mapping local history on paper with a tsquare, compass and old documents to digital is helpful in my recovery and turning out to be great for my moral.</p>
