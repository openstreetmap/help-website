So here is the thing what I did;</p><ul><li><p>First of all we need to install win10pcap for receiving the data packets from the external device.</p></li><li><p>The reason behind this is that normal winpcap has NDIS 5.X so by using this one we cannot capture the data packets from the external device in windows 10 OS.</p></li><li><p>Win10pcap comes with NDIS 6.x which is supported by windows 10 OS</p></li><li><p>Once we are done with this installation process then we need to make the necessary changes for Ethernet LAN connection i.e. changing the proxy and all those stuff.</p></li><li><p>Coming to the interface lists that will appear,now its working perfectly alright now. I can able to see the Ethernet connection and this is important because whenever we use wireshark we have this constraint to select a device from which we need to capture the data packets without which wireshark will give a pop up telling that we need to select a device(external device)</p></li></ul><p>Thanks and Regards Nandish Rao</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>20 Aug '15, 22:17</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e6e23e8aee92ade408c126f75d209d3f?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Nandish%20Rao&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Nandish Rao<br />
