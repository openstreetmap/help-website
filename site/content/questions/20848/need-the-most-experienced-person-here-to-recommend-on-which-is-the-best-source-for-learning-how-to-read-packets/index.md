longer version..</p><p>tons of resources are out there on the Web as well as on this q&amp;a forum. most of us don't need all that excess. in every topic (that is not based on taste, ie. the arts) there is always a best source. the same is true here. only the most experienced person (or someone who is highly skilled in selecting) would easily know what is the best</p><p>many things make it the best like it's the most updated (updated right now), and <strong>high usability</strong> -- any beginner would understand and easily learn, because the guide is good (top 1%). not productive for me to explain what qualities would lead to the best (top 1%), and their similarities and variation, on each and every topic from uv rays to wedding cakes. highly experienced people would already know on this particular one.</p><p>btw, i dont know if it is, but all this stuff and confusion being asked on the q&amp;a forum should be centralized as soon as they get solutions, just like it should be everywhere else on the Web -- which of course, is not, and that's why we have this continuing and insane problem of extensive fragmented info.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">resources</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>30 Apr '13, 00:24</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9e68df09ca4d71f4b8ac802b269c7647?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="bebetter&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>bebetter<br />

Simply put, it's very much like working with human languages; Wireshark can tell you that a conversation is "speaking Spanish" and present you with a transcript of what was said, but it's up to you to learn Spanish.</p><p>Toward that end--and since we have no idea of your knowledge level--I'll suggest starting with <a href="http://www.tcpipguide.com/free">The TCP/IP Guide</a>. There's a free online edition at that link, and it is also available in book form. (If you're new to networking, resist the urge to skip sections; that site's "Networking Fundamentals" section is a pretty good introduction...)</p><p>There is no single source that will teach you "how to read" every protocol dissected by Wireshark; once you get the fundamentals down, you'll need to find references for the protocols upon which you want to concentrate your efforts. There's an IBM Redbook, "<a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/gg243376.pdf">TCP/IP Tutorial and Technical Overview</a>", that goes into detail on several of the more common protocols. (Warning - that link is a 1000-page PDF.)</p><p>I'll also recommend the <a href="http://wiki.wireshark.org%3EWireshark%20wiki%3C/a%3E,%20especially%20the%20Protocol%20Reference%20and%20Sample%20Capture%20sections.%20%20It&#39;s%20quite%20useful%20to%20have%20a%20nice,%20clean%20sample%20capture%20when%20learning%20about%20a%20new%20protocol...%3C/p%3E"></a></p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>03 May '13, 13:32</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11ea89c2fd5a5830c69d0574a51b8142?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="wesmorgan1&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>wesmorgan1<br />

"section is a pretty good introduction..." the ... makes it seem like u are unsure of yourself. not a factor that confirms, just a minor probable little thing. too much to explain. not productive.</p><p>4.2 i am guessing that "I'll also recommend the" is edited out by you or someone due to lack of worth. good, i hate trash.</p><p>4.3 that tcp ip page is VERY POORLY ORGANIZED / BAD LAYOUT (AND HASN'T BEEN UPDATED IN FOREVER) and having been on FAR more pages on the Web then you have (i hav 753 tabs on chrome right now, and it has always been that way historically on firefox.), so i will tell right now that page is definitely not up to par. could have cleaned up all that badness on the tcp ip page. probably saw in ~2 yrs ago?? no idea, anyway, it went straight into <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nolijncfnkgaikbjbdaogikpmpbdcdef">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nolijncfnkgaikbjbdaogikpmpbdcdef</a></p><p>5) <strong>so IF there are no basic guides for this VERY SIMPLE thing yet in 2013, what to do?</strong> -- the most promising course of action in that scenario then -- is to postpone this question for over 730 days, in H2 2015, which i have done, though i'll check back on a quarterly basis, as also scheduled. most likely i will end up evetnually removing this page from my checkups after 2 quarters</p><p>can see my basic questions on <a href="http://ask.wireshark.org/users/2691/wiresharkhelpers">http://ask.wireshark.org/users/2691/wiresharkhelpers</a> , which i completley forgot what my pw was.</p><p>6) i dont need any of what i wrote here for what is the best (i already know everything, sorry i couldnt explain every single thing). i just wrote this for all of you so that a good source may (unlikely) be found/created</p><p>maybe one day i'll get around to creating a 'guide to data source' (since this is what this reply is about) and other actually helpful guides. more centeralized guides, less crap on the Web, please. not very happay :/</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>05 May '13, 10:35</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9e68df09ca4d71f4b8ac802b269c7647?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="bebetter&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>bebetter<br />
