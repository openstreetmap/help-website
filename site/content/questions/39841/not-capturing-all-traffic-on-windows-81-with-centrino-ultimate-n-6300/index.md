I don't know which ones do and which ones don't; you'll have to ask the vendor. Even if they <em>do</em> support it, if you're capturing on a "protected" network - i.e., one using WEP or WPA/WPA2, so that the traffic on the network is encrypted in order to make it harder to sniff - they might not support decrypting the traffic, so it might not look as if you're seeing the traffic. If you save the file in Network Monitor or pcap format, you may be able to read the file in Wireshark <a href="http://wiki.wireshark.org/HowToDecrypt802.11">and, if you supply the network's password and, for WPA/WPA2, you have captured the "EAPOL handshake", you might be able to decrypt it in Wireshark</a>.</p><p>Running Wireshark on Linux on a virtual machine, you might be able to capture in monitor mode, although <a href="http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/WLAN#Linux">you may have to use airmon-ng to turn monitor mode on</a> and, if you then capture on the monitor-mode device airmon-ng creates, you will have the same problems with "protected" networks as described in the previous paragraph.</p><p>Running Wireshark on Windows with an AirPcap device, you should be able to capture the traffic, but, again, decryption is necessary. I'm not sure whether the AirPcap card can do the decryption itself or not but, if so, you'll need to supply the network's password and, for WPA/WPA2, you'll have to capture the "EAPOL handshake".</p></div><div id="comment-40017-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(22 Feb '15, 19:11)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Guy Harris ♦♦</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-39844" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-39844-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
