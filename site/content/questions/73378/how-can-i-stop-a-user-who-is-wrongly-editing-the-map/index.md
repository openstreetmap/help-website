<p>Hello, I'm a user from South Korea. The user "maphunter36" is editing the map wrongly by putting Hambak-do (함박도) as the South Korean territory. ( Source : <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/history#map=15/37.7094/126.0885)">https://www.openstreetmap.org/history#map=15/37.7094/126.0885)</a></p>
<p>Hambak-do became the North Korean territory as a result of the Korean War.</p>

<p>According to the 1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement, “Within ten (10) days after this armistice agreement becomes effective, withdraw all of their military forces, supplies, and equipment from the rear and the coastal islands and waters of Korea of the other side. If such military forces are not withdrawn within the stated time limit, and there is no mutually agreed and valid reason for the delay, the other side shall have the right to take any action which it deems necessary for the maintenance of security and order. The term “coastal islands”, as used above, refers to those islands, which, though occupied by one side at the time when this armistice agreement becomes effective, were controlled by the other side on 24 June 1950; provided, however, that all the islands lying to the north and west of the provincial boundary line between HWANGHAE-DO and KYONGGI-DO shall be under the military control of the Supreme Commander of the Korean People’s Army and the Commander of the Chinese People’s volunteers, except the island groups of PAENGYONG-DO (37 58’ N, 124 40’ E), TAECHONG-DO (37 50’ N, 124 42’ E), SOCHONG-DO (37 46’ N, 124 46’ E), YONPYONG-DO (37 38’ N, 125 40’ E), and U-DO (37 36’N, 125 58’ E), which shall remain under the military control of the Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command. All the island on the west coast of Korea lying south of the above-mentioned boundary line shall remain under the military control of the Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command." (Source : <a href="http://www.dmzwar.com/korean-war-armistice-agreement/">http://www.dmzwar.com/korean-war-armistice-agreement/</a> )</p>
<p>Hambak-do is located northwest of the perforated line, which is the provincial boundary line between Hwanghae-do and Gyeonggi-do. Thus, according to the Armistice Agreement, Hambak-do belongs to DPRK. The island is controlled by the North Korean forces. And the South Korean Ministry of Defence recognizes it as the North Korean.</p>

<p>The most important rule when you see something wrong on the map is: Do not engage in edit wars. Of course you can fix something that is wrong, but if someone else then disagrees with you and removes your "fix" again, then <em>that</em> is the time to seek help (as you have done above) - and not after you have edited the object back and forth 15 times in the course of two weeks.</p>
<p>If you fix something that is wrong and someone else reverts that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a public comment on the changeset where they reverted your edit where you explain your point again and/or ask them why they reverted it and/or request that they reconsider their position.</li>
<li>If they do not react, you could try and seek help from the community, e.g. raise the matter on a relevant mailing list or forum or, in this case most likely, this telegram group <a href="https://t.me/osmKorea">https://t.me/osmKorea</a></li>
<li>If this fails, write to the data working group at data@osmfoundation.org and make your case.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have (in my capacity as a DWG member) blocked your account and that of the opposing party and requested both to explain their position. Nobody is ever "right" in an edit war.</p>
