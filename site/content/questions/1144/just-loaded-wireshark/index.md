KVM back in the days had a way of losing signals!<br />
</p><p>To move any active pane (visible or not), highlight the application in the task bar so it has the focus. Then hit ALT-SPACE Bar, then hit the letter "m" Alt-spacebar brings up the "move, minimize" dialog and "m" tells Windows you want to move/relocate the application.</p><p>Then just use your directional arrow keys to bring it all the way to the bottom and to the left. And you're all set!</p><p>This is the same reason why every Unix admin should know "vi" When you bring up a system from scratch (or after a crash), there's no emacs or anything other than "vi" 'course, it's been ages since I had to actually build a Unix system, so maybe things have changed.</p><p>Back in the days, I swore nothing was better than EDT editor on VAX I had my Procomm mapped out for like you wouldn't believe!!! Then I saw "vi" in action and fell in love. Now, while I still like vi, "Ultraedit" is pretty damn powerful.</p><p>One tidbit of info I learned from the Google guys at Sharkfest. gmail takes "vi" short cuts. So the navagational and other command keys work when using gmail. That I thought was pretty neat! :)</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>29 Nov '10, 14:01</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/63805f079ac429902641cad9d7cd69e8?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="hansangb&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>hansangb<br />
