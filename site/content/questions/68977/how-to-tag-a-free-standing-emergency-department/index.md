<p>In our area, the two large teaching hospitals ( Shands and NFRH ) have each established a number of outlying facilities that are legally categorized as 'Free Standing Emergency Departments'. They are essentially, the emergency department of a large hospital, without the ability to handle inpatient care. They perform two services: Treat &amp; Release and Stabilize &amp; Transport. Generally, they can handle cases up to, but not including, serious trauma.</p>
<p>Treat &amp; Release provides the services that would typically be outpatient (broken arm or leg, minor cuts, etc). Stabilize &amp; Transport is for more serious injuries, that require inpatient admission at the large central hospital.</p>
<p>These facilities are not hospitals in their own right, but are satellite appendages to a hospital that may be many km in distance.</p>
<p>One example, the one I would like to update, is node 4005121921. A similar facility is at node 6431819983 (which did not have a node, but I had to add for a reference). There are 3 or 4 other FSED in the greater Gainesville area.</p>

<p>It's only 1 data point, not really an established practice, but I've tagged quite a few of these as <code>amenity=clinic</code>, <code>emergency=yes</code>, <code>opening_hours=24/7</code>.</p>
<p>(and also <code>healthcare=clinic</code>).</p>
<p>I guess there is an argument to be made for a more specific tag or maybe <code>amenity=doctors</code> with emergency and opening_hours tags, but they usually have on site imaging and things like that, so are more capable than a typical doctors office.</p>

<p>There's a couple ways to improve the situation. You could use the <code>amenity=clinic</code> tag and then also use <code>healthcare=freestanding_emergency_department</code>, and hope that the second tag catches on.</p>
<p>Another option along those lines would be to use <code>amenity=clinic</code> and <code>healthcare=clinic</code> and then add a <code>clinic=freestanding_emergency_department</code> tag. OSM tags often follow the pattern of having a more general primary tag and a more specific secondary tag. I think I prefer that to a top level amenity or healthcare tag, but again that's just 1 opinion, not anything established.</p>
<p>You could post about it on the wiki or tagging mailing lists and see what people have to say. Maybe the broader community likes the idea of a specific top level tag.</p>
