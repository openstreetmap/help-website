<p>The boundaries of postcodes/places in Lake County, California where I live are completely wrong such that address resolution does not work. I have a shapefile which was provided to me by the county from their GIS system with the correct boundaries as recorded on parcel records. The files contain only the boundaries and the largest is about 200kb. However, after reading the cautions about importing shapefiles I'm reluctant to procede without more guidance about how to use the shapefiles to correct the boundaries.</p>
