<p>sorry, I have difficulties to understand your question and situation. Are you talking of a street sign? What is its text? And you want to map the sign as radio=no on a highway osm way?</p>

<p>It’s an Industrial area with some rules on an entry sign. So if you’re going in follow the access rules, such as maxspeed, smoking no and radio no. JOSM complaints that there s no railway ?</p>

<p>what is the rule on the sign? Is it forbidding mobile phone use?</p>
<p>Why JOSM complains? Because, apparently (according <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/?key=radio#values">to taginfo</a>) <code>radio</code> is used in the railway context to denote which radio standard is used for this specific railway line (e.g. GSM-R is such a radio standard). And I guess you are using <code>radio</code> on a highway or even landuse.</p>

<p>To clarify the original question, I've seen signs in areas were rock blasting was being performed where there were signs requiring all two-way radios to be turned off. My guess is there was a chance that a radio transmitter could trigger a explosive charge. Maybe they were being overly cautious, but I recall seeing such signs. Here are some web example signs: <a href="https://ixquick-proxy.com/do/show_picture.pl?l=english&amp;rais=1&amp;oiu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.compliancesigns.com%2Fmedia%2FNH%2Fworkplace-safety%2F1000%2FMining-Sign-NHEP-19788_1000.gif&amp;sp=27d981556cd0a1d3880e3f22736f06eb">https://ixquick-proxy.com/do/show_picture.pl?l=english&amp;rais=1&amp;oiu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.compliancesigns.com%2Fmedia%2FNH%2Fworkplace-safety%2F1000%2FMining-Sign-NHEP-19788_1000.gif&amp;sp=27d981556cd0a1d3880e3f22736f06eb</a> and <a href="https://s17-us2.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.mysafetysign.com%2Fimg%2Flg%2FS%2Fturn-off-radio-sign-s-7962.png&amp;sp=0951b40d2d065cdd2627c1ee2af415c0">https://s17-us2.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.mysafetysign.com%2Fimg%2Flg%2FS%2Fturn-off-radio-sign-s-7962.png&amp;sp=0951b40d2d065cdd2627c1ee2af415c0</a></p>
