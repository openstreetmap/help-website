<p>Can anyone offer some advice on whether there is some kind of openstreetmap collaborative road trip planner?</p>
<p>A group of about 12 of us are planning a road trip through southern africa early next year and we are trying to plan our route. Obviously it is a bit of a negotiation and everyone is researching different bits. What would be really useful would be to be able to collaboratively work on the route until we get something we are all happy with. Is there a website / some other way of achieving this?</p>
<p>It would be kind of similar to collaborating via GoogleMaps 'My map' feature however, as we are working out the route ourselves, automated routing (as offered on a few websites) isn't really necessary. What we need is a common 'space' to share some waypoints over a map with a line linking them together.</p>
<p>In the end we would want to export it as a .gpx file and set off!</p>
<p>Does anyone know if such a thing exists or if there is another way to do it?</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Nick</p>

<p>Cool,</p>
<p>thank you for the tips. I'll give them both a go and see how I get on. I'd like to do all the planning with OSM so that I can see if there are any gaps in the map and then I can help close them up when we are there.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.umapper.com/">umapper.com</a></strong> will let you do this. In fact they've added some nice 'user permissions' controls since I last played with it. You have to create an account, and then you can create a map with lines/markers, and then you can set it to "wiki" mode, meaning anyone can add and change lines/markers (with some security implications!), but now you can also nominate other registered <a href="http://umapper.com">umapper.com</a> users to be able to view/edit.</p>
<p>Example: <a href="http://www.umapper.com/maps/view/id/117768/">http://www.umapper.com/maps/view/id/117768/</a></p>
<p>This site requires flash.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.arcgis.com"></a><a href="http://arcgis.com">arcgis.com</a></strong> is a new option for this kind of thing, although not as good as umapper for "collaboration". It lets you pick OpenStreetMap as a basemap option, and then you can add an 'editable layer' which is quite a flexible 'my maps' kind of feature. If you register for an account you can 'share' your map at a URL.</p>
<p>Example: <a href="http://bit.ly/sAQFwL">http://bit.ly/sAQFwL</a></p>
<p>But this sharing doesn't seem to include any collaboration features. There's no "allow other people to edit" option that I can see.</p>

<p>Nice. Thanks for all the suggestions.</p>
<p>I'm going to give <a href="http://umapper.com">umapper.com</a> a go. As Harry says, MyMaps on MapQuest doesn't seem to be working, myscenicdrive isn't OSM based and I'm a new convert to QGIS, so ArcGIS doesn't float my boat...</p>
<p>Seriously though it's important that it is OSM based as that's the map that I'm planning on loading into my Garmin, so I'd rather find problems with it now (and fix them) than once we're halfway across the Kalahari...</p>
<p>If anyone's got any other blinders then please don't hesitate to let me know... In the meantime I'll be mapping.</p>

<p>Maybe have a look at the answers to <a href="/questions/9335/is-it-possible-to-place-temporary-private-marks">this question</a>? I suggested Mapquest Open in response there, and it might work for you here too. I've not tried to use it collaboratively, though - you'd need to see if it worked for you.</p>

<p>Another collaborative way to plan your road trip would be with <a href="http://myscenicdrives.com">myscenicdrives.com</a>'s road trip planner. After giving all the authors write permissions to your trip, you can each easily make changes, undo previous edits, etc., all with a very powerful feature set. Take a look at <a href="https://www.myscenicdrives.com/road-trip-planner">https://www.myscenicdrives.com/road-trip-planner</a> .</p>
