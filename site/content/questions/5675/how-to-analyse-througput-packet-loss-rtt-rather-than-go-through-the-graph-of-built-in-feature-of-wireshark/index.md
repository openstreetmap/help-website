You can do that by using the Conversations Statistic (in the Statistics menu) and filter the conversation from the TCP tab. The use the popup menu to filter the conversation. The conversation statistic can also tell you the <strong>throughput</strong> per TCP session right away (bps A-&gt;B and bps B-&gt;A).</p><p>For the <strong>packet loss</strong> you can then append the conversation filter with "<code>and tcp.analysis.lost_segment</code>", then look at the status bar to see how many packets match the filter ("Displayed:" value).</p><p>The <strong>RTT</strong> can be determined by finding out how long it took for the Three Way Handshake, meaning that you set a Time reference to the SYN and then read the relative time of the third packet (ACK). That will give you the initial RTT; if you want the various RTT values for the length of the communication you should use the Statistics -&gt; TCP Stream Graph -&gt; Round Trip Time Graph.</p><p>On a side note: I think RTT and packet loss values are not that important when comparing stack types, because the stack has little to no influence over what happens in transit (delays and packet drops in the network infrastructure). Keep an eye on the mechanisms dealing with recovery from packet loss (including "how fast was the problem solved, and how bad was the impact on time/throughput"); these are much more interesting.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>12 Aug '11, 05:52</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c578ba2967741f25aebd6afef702f432?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Jasper&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>Jasper ♦♦</span><br />

Please explain briefly, that how to analyse throughput of whole captured file. As I know by applying particular filter we can capture particular connection n by viewing statics summary we can analyse the throughput which defines most f things but don't know how to calculate exactly. Similarly, for packet loss by applying tcp.analysis.lost_segment, how to calculate total packet loss in whole in large captured file where packet losses are more than one. Actually I am working on simple topology, consist of only one router and three servers, HTTP Server, SMTP Server, n Streaming Server. Delay n packet loss is employed such as 20ms, 1.5%, 30ms 2.5%,40 3.5%, 50ms 4.5% respectively. Each employed parameters(delay and packet loss) are tested five times on each said variant of TCP(said in request). Everything is done at the moment but strucked at how to analyse things accurately although I captured all relevant packets by applying particular capture filter i.e. http filter for http, rtcp(real time tcp) for streaming and smtp for smtp. Kindly explain in clear and in easier way because I am having very short time to complete report.</p><p>Once Again Thanks for your concern.</p><p>waiting for response!</p><p>sur</p></div><div id="comment-5694-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(12 Aug '11, 15:39)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sur</span></div></div><span id="5695"></span><div id="comment-5695" class="comment"><div id="post-5695-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>First of all, I converted your answer to a comment to keep this a Q&amp;A flow.</p><p>Second, you should be aware that this is a forum to help with questions and problems, not the Report-O-Matic that does your homework for you ;-)</p><p>Third, I do not have trace files for you; if you need any you can get them at the Wireshark repository at http://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures.</p><p>Finally, I think I gave quite accurate steps to get the metrics for single connections.
