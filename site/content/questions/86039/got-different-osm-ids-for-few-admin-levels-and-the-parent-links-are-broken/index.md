<p>I installed Nominatim two days ago and found that a few records got different OSM ids compared to the ones in the osm search. Because of that, the parent id links are broken in the installation.</p>
<p>For example, for OSM_ID id in OSM 63512 ( Maine state in USA) I got OSM_ID 316961875 in my installation. In fact, I don't find any record with OSM_ID 63512. Because of this, all the child nodes got impacted, they got parent_id as zero. Like this, there are 11 states got impacted and many children.</p>
<p>I am confused about what went wrong and not sure if it is a bug or something else I am missing.</p>
<p>This count shows the ones whose admin-level nodes got different OSM_IDS. All the children depending on these nodes are impacted due to this.<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10221950/199001616-ce0b040b-7626-480e-9476-d23019a41897.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> - In the USA all other states are with admin_level =4 and class='boundary' and type='administrative'. But American Samoa, Maine, MD got the class as 'place' and type as 'state'</p>
