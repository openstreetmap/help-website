<p>Hello, unfortunately I did not find an answer yet: In Germany there are mushroom advisory centers: A mushroom advisory center, also called a mushroom information center in Austria and a mushroom control center or mushroom control in Switzerland, is a public place where private mushroom pickers can have their collected supposed edible mushrooms examined, identified and tested for toxicity by mushroom experts. (translated based on wikipedia (<a href="https://wiki.adminforge.de/wiki/Pilzberatungsstelle)">https://wiki.adminforge.de/wiki/Pilzberatungsstelle)</a> with deepl).</p>
<p>There is a list available of all registered advisors with their private address and (mobile) number: <a href="https://www.dgfm-ev.de/service/pilzsachverstaendige">https://www.dgfm-ev.de/service/pilzsachverstaendige</a></p>
<p>So there are two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to map those? I couldn't find a corresponding category in iD editor</li>
<li>Would it be possible to automatically scrape <a href="https://www.dgfm-ev.de/service/pilzsachverstaendige">https://www.dgfm-ev.de/service/pilzsachverstaendige</a> and put the information in osm? Where to start?</li>
</ol>
<p>Kind regards and thank you for the answer</p>

<p>There are 3 mapped (<a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1mFa)">https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1mFa)</a> in Aarau (CH), but incorrectly with the name on a house address. This is a pretty niche topic so probably the best approach is to propose a given key/tag combination.</p>
<p>If these are to be mapped I think it is very important to add opening hours (usually 1 to 2 hours a week during the fungi season) &amp; contact info. At least in CH there is usually a single nominated Pilzkontrolleur/in with a deputy/alternate for a given area. This should be captured too.</p>
<p>You can only scrape the info from sites if they give you explicit permission. There is also a slight issue with personal information as these are usually named individuals at private addresses (not in ZUrich, where the service is run from offices in Kries 11).</p>
