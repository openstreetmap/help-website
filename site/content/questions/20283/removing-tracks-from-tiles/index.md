<p>I am using MotionX GPS which employs your tile set "OpenCycleMap".</p>
<p>However, in addition to my tracks, there are dozens of other tracks by other users present on the tiles that obscure my tracks - particularly in the City of San Francisco, CA and in Berkeley, CA.</p>
<p>I contacted MotionX GPS and they indicated that these tracks could not be deleted because they were part of your tile set.</p>
<p>Is there any way you can delete them from the tile-set used by MotionX GPS.</p>
<p>The problem is that when I put in one of my tracks in San Francisco, it is impossible for me to visualize the track because there are so many other tracks already in place.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Any chance of posting a screenshot showing the problem? I don't see "tracks from other users" present on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/motionx-gps/id299949744?mt=8">screenshots on this page</a>. I do see OpenCycleMap tiles in those pictures, but I don't see any GPS tracks from other users e.g. <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=37.76602&amp;lon=-122.39153&amp;zoom=16&amp;layers=C">here</a>. Even a ropy picture from another cameraphone would help.</p>

<p>There may be a confusion between user tracks and mapped tracks ?</p>
<ul>
<li>The OpenCycleMap tileset displays road/paths/etc that are labeled (in real life) as being intended for bycicles (in town or in the countryside, dedicated to bikes or shared with pedestrians, etc). At some zoom levels, they are displayed in fairly bright in-your-face colors.</li>
<li>Many smartphone apps (and apparently MotionX too) allow you to record a trip you've made, display it on a map, and even share it with other users. How those are displayed depend on the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>From your question, I believe that the MotionX support is talking about the former, while you are talking about the later.</p>
<p>The OpenCycleMap tileset is used by many people, so agreeing on a modification can be tricky. You can always try to contact <a href="http://www.gravitystorm.co.uk/andy/">the OCM maintainer</a> about it, but it is probably better to contact the MotionX support again so they can improve things on their side. Ask them to either :</p>
<ul>
<li>Change (or make configurable) how they display user tracks in the app so that it won't clash with the tileset.</li>
<li>Support other tilesets which do not clash with how they display user tracks.</li>
</ul>
