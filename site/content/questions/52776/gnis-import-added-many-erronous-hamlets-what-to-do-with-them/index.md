<p>I have noticed many place=hamlet locations in my area, and when searching for locations in OSMAnd, these come up and are a bit confusing. I started poking through the data, where I saw many strange places being identified as hamlets: trailer parks, a historic-named hill with no notable residential areas, a beach, and a named cul-du-sac housing area. These areas are obviously not incorporated, independent entities, as the term hamlet suggests. I have been changing many of them to neighbourhoods, where a residential community exists (perhaps suburb is better in those areas near cities), but some of these are not even residential neighborhoods, which leaves me puzzled on how to fix them.</p>
<p>Since this GNIS import has dates from many years ago, I thought that I would ask here to see how other people decided to massage this data to be more accurate. Any advice?</p>

<p>There was a big discussion of it a while ago:</p>

<p>The linked diary post provides quite a bit of context:</p>

<p>Unmapped places highlights some of them:</p>
<p><a href="http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/unmapped">http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/unmapped</a></p>
<p>I think neighborhood and suburb are good changes for many of them. I'm not sure anyone has really come up with a solution for the odder ones (Except maybe deletion by someone who knows that a place isn't called that).</p>
