<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Here in NZ, motorways and highways are different things. The Kapiti Expressway, part of State Highway 1, is built out like a motorway, and has separate shared walking &amp; cycling paths. Around here: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/479013858">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/479013858</a></p>
<p>It is also by law a highway where bicycles (and horses, pedestrians etc) are perfectly allowed, on the shoulder.</p>
<p>In places the highway is also absolutely the only rideable connection this side of the mountains -- especially between Waikanae and Peka Peka. I.e. there is no separate path here.</p>
<p>The effect is that komoot routes bicycles via the Mangaone Walkway where it's not actually allowed to ride.</p>
<p>Is there a way to mark the expressway appropriately?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I see you edited already? You should accept the answer. You may want to check if <code>=use_sidepath</code> applies there. Additionally, the shoulder can be tagged with <code>shoulder=left</code>, etc. As for using <code>highway=motorway</code> on NZ's Expressways, you could ask and discuss this with your national community. Something you can look into is a few road sections around Christchurch tagged as <code>motorroad=yes</code> by someone.</p>

<p>Yes I found out how to edit. And I've accepted the answer -- didn't know about that feature.</p>
<p>Here in NZ a highway is not the same as a motorway. Highways are roads of different buildout, maintained by central government, but usable by car, foot, horse, bicycle etc. Motorways are usually highways and then only motorised traffic is allowed. It's a little different from most places :)</p>

<p>Also, there are just a handful of 'expressways' around the country -- not worth another category IMHO</p>

<p>You could simply add <code>bicycle=yes</code>. <code>shoulder=yes</code> is also worth adding so that route-planners know there's a safe(ish) place to ride. Note that route-planners typically take a while to reflect any changes you've made to the map.</p>
<p>(If there's a separate path, that should of course be mapped separately, and looks like it is.)</p>

<p>I think this is the best approach, as there are plenty of countries that do allow pedestrian and bicycle use of motorway shoulders. One of my local Motorways is a specifically classified as a bike route. And tagged as such on OSM.</p>
