<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have to add offline maps to an app. the app has a list of locations that the user selects and views when he is online. The locations are dynamic on static, user can select any location. We are using MKMapkit to display locations when user is online. And we will continue using MKMapkit for online tracking of locations</p>
<p>When the user goes offline (no network access) we need to plot all the locations that were listed when the user was online into the offline map by adding annotations and having different images for the pins based on certain criteria.</p>
<p>Is it possible to add pins or annotations of dynamic locations selected by the user in my app when the user was online into the offline map when user has no network access.</p>
<p>Our requirement is also to add routes between the locations as well.</p>
<p>If the above specified scenario is possible, it would be of great help if the steps to achieve it is provided.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Is this at all related to OpenStreetMap? And wouldn't you be better of asking this on whatever resouces Apple provides for dev support?</p>
