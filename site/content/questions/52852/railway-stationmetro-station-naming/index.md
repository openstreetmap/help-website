<p>My recollection of HK is that the word "station" doesn't appear on MTR ground signage. Is that correct?</p>

<p>It does (capitalised), but that doesn't really seem to be pertinent because many metros and subways (e.g. London, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen) have "station" in their signage but omit "Station" in <code>name=*</code> anyway.</p>
<p>"Station" is, however, omitted in MTR platform decorations/signage.</p>

<p>I've reverted the changes because he seems to only have changed about 15 stations' names without bothering to edit the rest, leaving strange inconsistency.</p>
