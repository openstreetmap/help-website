One is the bit position of your 64 bits regardless their interpretation and the other one is the encoding.</p><p>So what I would do would be to create a dynamic tvb of 8 bytes, copy the interesting part of the original TVB to it, shifting it by 4 bits, and add a plain <code>uint64</code> or <code>string</code> field to the dissection tree, referring to that created TVB rather than the original data. If you choose the field type to be <code>string</code> with <code>base.ASCII</code>, causing character 4 to be displayed for byte value of 0x34, and you get nothing or nonsense displayed as the string value, the next step would be to either replace 0x00 (NUL) by 0x20 (SP) while copying data from source tvb to the auxiliary tvb or to identify the position of the first digit and set the starting position and size of the field accordingly when adding it to the tree.</p><p>The drawback of this workaround is that if you click the item in the dissection tree, the corresponding bytes will not be highlighted in the original packet bytes pane but in the tab representing the auxiliary tvb.</p><p>The suggestion below is a blind shot in the part of converting the original tvb into the hexdigit string you need to create the auxiliary tvb, so you'll likely have to fight the battle with type mismatch yourself.</p><pre><code>local UselessString,MyString = tvb:range(start_position,9):bytes():string():match(&quot;.(.*).&quot;)

To do so, it is necessary to use <code>tvb:range(pos,9):bitfield(4,64)</code> instead of just <code>tvb:range(pos,9)</code> as the <code>tvbrange</code> parameter of <code>treeitem:add</code> or <code>tvbrange:uint64()</code>. However, if done this way, the source area of the packet bytes pane is not highlighted when the corresponding tree item is selected. To fix this, it is necessary to use <code>treeitem:set_len(9)</code> (as <a href="https://ask.wireshark.org/users/402/cmaynard">@cmaynard</a> did in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45543174/lua-display-field-ascii-dissector">his answer on Stack Overflow</a>)</p></li><li><p>it is possible to use own code to calculate a value of a field from whatever exotic encoding is used in he protocol, and then add to the tree a protocol field whose type doesn't match by number of bytes, nevertheless indicating those bytes as a source of the field, and set the calculated value.</p></li></ol><p>In this particular case, where the protocol encodes the numeric ID as a right-aligned string of ASCII-encoded digits, left-stuffed with ASCII NUL (0x0), so a 32-bit unsigned integer is sufficient to accomodate the result, the corresponding code would be:</p><pre><code>...
local blas_id = ProtoField.uint32 (&quot;myProto.blas_id&quot;, &quot;Blas ID&quot;, base.DEC)
...
local my_string = tostring(tvbuf:range(0,9)):match(&quot;.(.*).&quot;):gsub(&quot;00&quot;,&quot;30&quot;,7):gsub(&quot;3(%d)&quot;,&quot;%1&quot;,8)
local my_number = tonumber(my_string)
myProto_tree:add(blas_id,buf(0,9),my_number)</code></pre><p>The first line of the extraction code could be written in easier to understand individual steps:</p><pre><code>step1 = tvbuf:range(0,9)            -- extract the bytes
step2 = tostring(my_tvb_range)      -- step2 now contains each byte as two hex digits 0-F
step3 = step2:match(&quot;.(.*).&quot;)       -- step3 now contains the interesting part, without the first and last nibble, as hex digits
step4 = step3:gsub(&quot;00&quot;,&quot;30&quot;,8)     -- hex digit pairs 00 are replaced by hex digit pairs 30
step5 = step4:gsub(&quot;3(%d)&quot;,&quot;%1&quot;,8)  -- each hex digit pair (30..39) is replaced by the character representing the digit itself</code></pre><p>This way, the value of the field, which can be used in display filter, is the final numeric one. So if the source 9 bytes would be e.g. <code>f0000003132333435f</code>, the corresponding display filter would be <code>myProto.blas_id == 12345</code>.</p><p>The code does not handle exceptions. If any other ASCII characters than NUL and digits 0-9 occur in the source tvb range, the resulting field value becomes incorrect.</p></div><div id="comment-63467-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(11 Aug '17, 10:46)</span> sindy</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-63286" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 6 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 1 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-63286-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
