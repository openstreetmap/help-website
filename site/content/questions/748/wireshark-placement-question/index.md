Bandwidth Management refers to the capability of a network to provide better service to selected network traffic. The RV042 provides two types of functionality, and only one type of functionality can work at any one time. One type is Rate Control for minimum bandwidth (guarantee bandwidth) and maximum bandwidth (limit bandwidth) by Service and/or IP Address. The other type is Priority for services. Both functionalities can control Inbound or Outbound traffic.</p><p><strong>Rate Control</strong><br />
The RV042 provides Rate Control for guaranteeing or limiting the specific Service and/or IP address for inbound traffic or outbound traffic at specific minimum or maximum rate.</p><p>Thank you in advance</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">vpn placement secure wireshark</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>30 Oct '10, 15:21</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bcfdf26904f3a8a9fb69c7ca0dc5e7b1?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="net_tech&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>net_tech<br />

Because traffic needs to be encapsulated in the VPN protocol (IPsec most probably), there will be an additional header to each packet. For packets that already are at maximum size, this would create packets that can't be transported over the network.</p><p>When nothing fancy is done by the VPN routers, the IP layer will take care of this by fragmenting the (too large) IP packets. But... if the DF (Don't Fragment) bit is set in the IP header of the packet, the router is not allowed to do that. The VPN router that wants to do fragmentation, but is not allowed to by the DF bit will send an "ICMP Fragmentation Needed, but DF bit set" message (ICMP type 3 code 4) back to the sender indicating this problem. If this is the case in your setup, you should be able to see those messages in Wireshark on the Win2008 server.</p><p>There are a few solutions for this situation:</p><ul><li><p>Change the MTU size of all systems behind the VPN so that each packet will have room left for the encapsulation header. Of course this would reduce performance for systems that communicate to each other without crossing the VPN</p></li><li><p>Have the VPN routers change the MSS (Maximum segment size) value in the TCP options. This way, for TCP connections, the maximum payload size (and therefor packet size) will be dynamically lowered. For other protocols (like UDP and so), this will not change anything, but the DF bit is mostly set on TCP packets, so in practice this will do just fine. Of course the VPN routers need to have the option to adjust the MSS value.</p></li></ul><p>As for the original question, I would place wireshark on the Win2008 server or in between the Win2008 server and RV042 and start looking for ICMP type 3 code 4 messages.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>31 Oct '10, 02:07</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7901a94d8fdd1f9f47cda9a32fcfa177?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="SYN-bit&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>SYN-bit ♦♦<br />

Is MMS also known as MTU or they are two separate settings? I could not find MMS setting in RV042, so changed MTU from Auto to Manual and set it to 1492 bytes. Assuming in Auto it was 1500? Surprisingly enough all communication problems that existed previously got resolved. 30 is a remote network for me, but I would certainly get a trace next time I am physically there. Also in the trace I got on the client from the 20 network there are 67 ICMP packets with TTL exceeded message (Fragment reassembly time exceeded)</p></div><div id="comment-758-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(31 Oct '10, 11:02)</span> net_tech</div></div><span id="759"></span><div id="comment-759" class="comment"><div id="post-759-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>MSS stands for maximum Segment Size and is TCP related. MTU stands for Maximum Transmission Unit and is Link Layer related. But in the end they have a close relation as the MSS is calculated from the MTU by subtracting the IP and TCP header sizes (20+20). So on a network with MTU=1500, the MSS is 1460.</p><p>You might need to lower your MTU even more, as IPsec adds more than 8 bytes of headers. An MTU of 1420 is seen quite often to incorporate IPsec on top of GRE. So 1420 is a safe value to use.</p></div><div id="comment-759-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(31 Oct '10, 12:16)</span> SYN-bit ♦♦</div></div><span id="760"></span><div id="comment-760" class="comment"><div id="post-760-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks again and I will experement with the values.</p><p>If MTU is set correctly I should not see any ICMP TTL exceeded messages on the client right?</p></div><div id="comment-760-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(31 Oct '10, 12:48)</span> net_tech</div></div><span id="761"></span><div id="comment-761" class="comment"><div id="post-761-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>If MTU is set correctly, you should not see any "ICMP fragmentation needed, but DF bit set" messages (for traffic between the 20 and 30 network).</p><p>I'm sure you should also not see "TTL exceeded, Fragment reassembly time exceeded" for traffic between the 20 and 30 network then.</p></div><div id="comment-761-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(31 Oct '10, 13:04)</span> SYN-bit ♦♦</div></div><span id="765"></span><div id="comment-765" class="comment"><div id="post-765-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Is there any logic to why the problem didn't exist with communications to Windows 2003 server running on the same ESXi when there was an MTU mismatch?</p><p>Both servers return "Packet needs to be fragmented but DF set" for packets larger than 1472</p><p>ping -f -l 1473 192.168.30.1 (2003 Server)</p><p>Packet needs to be fragmented but DF set</p><p>ping -f -l 1473 192.168.30.5 (2008 Server)</p><p>Packet needs to be fragmented but DF set</p></div><div id="comment-765-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(01 Nov '10, 08:44)</span> net_tech</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-754" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-754-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
