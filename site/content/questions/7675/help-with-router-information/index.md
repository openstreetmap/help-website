I've had to figure out a lot of things to get to what was going on and I recently used Wireshark to see if I can find the problem. I use an ethernet cable. There is a Linksys Cisco nat router on it. It is shared by three computers. I have used many different types of firewalls and when I block what appears to be the offender, I get no internet service. I did a Wireshark capture and found references to "CompalIn." We don't have any Compal equipment at the house. Can someone explain that to me? I can add more details from the file. Note that my computer is SO HACKED right now that almost all the services are run by netsvc when I am supposedly NOT connected to the internet and have disabled all the internet adapters. I also don't have access to the information in the taskmanager and other scary things. With the adapters uninstalled, Wireshark won't capture anything of course. Thanks.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">router hackers</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>28 Nov '11, 08:43</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d390ea629e0c22c5ba9c60f35126874d?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Victim&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Victim<br />

I used the wireshark program when I was online after hacking number one billion. At that point, wireshark generated a file. The file is rife with odd information. I am asking a question about that.
