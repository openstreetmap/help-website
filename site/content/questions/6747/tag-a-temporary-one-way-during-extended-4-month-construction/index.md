<p>As I guide my car down what was left of a two lane road that is now under major reconstruction and reduced to one lane, a question came to mind. Since the road is now one way and will most likely be for a couple of months, should I revise the OSM map to reflect it?</p>
<p>The road has been reduced to from a two lane, two way street to one lane. The work has been going on since March (3+ months), and involves relocating all major utilities. It looks like the work is scheduled to go through the end of the year. I am not sure how long they expect to keep it one way.</p>

<p>I was able to find a published expected end date of "9/15/2011". So for now, I will not make it a oneway road, but instead add "temporary:oneway=yes" and "temporary:oneway=2011-09-15". Too bad I can only accept one answer.</p>

<p>See this previous question, and in particular the answer from Jochen Topf: <a href="http://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/259/temporary-road-works-and-traffic-situations">Temporary road works and traffic situations</a>.</p>
<p>Note that people are using OSM data for a variety of things, eg downloading to their GPS device, and they might only update their map every few months. So your temporary change might be around for a lot longer than you expect.</p>
<p>In general, if the road works etc is very short-term (eg a few days), then its best not to change it. If its more than a few months, then it probably is worth changing. Though it would be a good idea to add a note to remember to resurvey it and change it back, possibly with a fixme tag with the estimated date.</p>

<p>Lots of good answers, but I think this is best for now; or at least until there is widespread use of the temporary tags (which I may also add).</p>

<p>One of the biggest advantages OSM has over other maps is the ability to reflect short-term changes like this one. As long as you drive the route frequently enough to note when it's repaired--and are willing to retag the way back to two-way--I think you should go ahead. You could also add a note= tag explaining what you've done.</p>

<p>Making a "permanent" change to the map, even only temporarily, could affect people who may be using a download including this temporary change for some time to come. Even some of the frequently-used tools are only updating their database every few weeks or so.</p>
<p>You might want to look at the proposed tagging scheme for such temporary changes... <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/temporary">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/temporary</a></p>
<p>Using that proposed scheme, you would add (replacing xx-xx as appropriate)</p>
<ul>
<li>temporary:oneway=yes</li>
<li>temporary:date_on=2011-xx-xx</li>
<li>temporary:date_off=2011-xx-xx</li>
</ul>
<p>This also has the advantage that it's not relying on anybody to explicitly remember to "put it back later".</p>
<p>I don't think renderers or routers are currently using these though, so perhaps for now the tagging for temporary features is useless in practice?</p>
