This does 2.4 and 5GHz bands.</p><p>One Netgear variant:</p><pre><code>Bus 002 Device 004: ID 0846:9012 NetGear, Inc. WNDA4100 802.11abgn 3x3:3 [Ralink RT3573]</code></pre><p>As well, the Savvius 802.11n adapters use the same chipset, so they work just the same as would just about any device with this chipset:</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Savvius-OmniWiFi-Capture-Adapter-802-11a/dp/B00AOBXK9S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482870179&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=savvius">https://www.amazon.com/Savvius-OmniWiFi-Capture-Adapter-802-11a/dp/B00AOBXK9S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482870179&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=savvius</a></p><p>I can't help with npcap - never works for me as I always get a BSoD. Good luck - maybe others can help you get something going with this. I looked forward to when it is stabilized.</p><p>The Savvius 802.11ac adapter is crappy - very poor Rx strength so do not recommend it unless you really need to do 802.11ac, but even then, I would still look for another solution. Does not work in Linux, either: can compile a STA driver but no monitor mode support.<br />
</p><p>The AirPcap Nx is weak - does not support short guard interval so you will likely miss a LOT of traffic, so that fails your reliable requirement but is 2x2 802.11n. Works nicely in Windows for what it does capture unless you use Windows7 &amp; USB3 (we do... and no, it doesn't work then), and Linux enumerates it as:</p><pre><code>Bus 001 Device 004: ID cace:0300 CACE Technologies Inc. AirPcap NX [Atheros AR9001U-(2)NG]</code></pre><p>It looks like it uses the carl9170 driver on my 4.8 series kernel:</p><pre><code>usbcore: registered new interface driver carl9170
usb 1-1.1: firmware: direct-loading firmware carl9170-1.fw</code></pre><p>Only problem is that all the chipsets that I have that use the carl9170 driver support monitor mode, however, they do not do promiscuous mode. I understand this to be a kernel regression in the driver from a number of years ago, but it is what it is: not really useful for wifi packet capture as only broadcast and multicast traffic come in.</p><p>Note also you have Microsoft Network Monitor tool that can capture wifi frames. It will save as pcap then can analyze ex post facto with Wireshark or whatever. Not as good as real time capture, but sometimes we have to live with less than ideal...</p><p>The Acrylic WiFi guys may have a driver for some devices as well on Windows.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>27 Dec '16, 12:40</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a47ef51dd9c9996d194a4983295f5a4?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Bob%20Jones&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>Bob Jones</span><br />
