<p>I downloaded a map of Québec, and it is showing up perfectly on my Mac, with every detail showing on the map. However, in the menu on the left, under the device at the top of the page, it is not listed under the drop-down. On the GPS itself, it is listed as enabled, but it does not appear to be shown as a map on the device. I disabled the other maps, and left this one as the only one enabled, and still it does not show on the screen. Why would that be, and is there something different that I can do? I used Garmin MapInstall to put it on the device (as opposed to a miniSD), and there were no error messages.</p>

<p>I have been fooled a couple of times by these effects. Is the gps enabled and indicating enough satellites to locate, outdoors? and is it in the same area as the map, you could get the device to display a lat lon to check. Secondly what does the scale show when in map view? you may be zoomed into an empty area or zoomed out so far the the map is so small it cannot be seen. If you have loaded a map for an area you are not in at the moment you could create a waypoint that is in the area of the map and display that, then see if zooming in or out to a sensible scale solves the problem.</p>

<p>Thank you for the answer, but I checked all of those things, and it does not seem to make any difference. I stil cannot see the OSM on the device. I've been zooming in and out from my home location where I know the streets and layout.</p>
