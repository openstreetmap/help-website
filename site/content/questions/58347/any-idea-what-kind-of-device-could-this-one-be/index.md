In your case we are looking at "Shenzhen". I never heard of this manufacturer, but a quick visit to a search engine delivers a short <a href="http://www.hktdc.com/manufacturers-suppliers/ShenZhen-Coninental-Wireless-Technology-co-Ltd/en/1X08ZTG5/">text snippet</a>:</p><p><code>ShenZhen Continental Wireless Technology co.,Ltd of shenzhen was established in 2008. And owning a registgered capital of 10 million RMB. We are focusing on the development ,produce and sale of digital products. We provide Professional ending products or ODM solutions such as Smart watch,Smart glass, Bluetooth headsets, back-up power supply, accessories of digital,application platform and so on. by continuously strengthening the research of the core technology with independent intellectual property rights,Continuous improvement of the product quality and...</code></p><p>(Note: typos are present in the original text)</p><p>Please keep in mind, that MAC addresses can be changed in software or the vendor IDs (the first 3 bytes in the MAC address) can be reassigned over time, for example when a manufacturer goes out of business. Both explanations are not very likely. So we assume for the moment, that we have a genuine ShenZhen MAC address.</p><p>The text snippet mentioned above suggests, that the company manufactures and sells bulk quantities of gadgets which would be labeled with another brand.</p><p>Maybe you can check your home for recent new devices, gadgets, christmas presents etc. This could be a smart watch, a GPS device, a fitness tracker, that Internet-enabled refrigerator, the new boom box, cloud-connected toy, internet-ready barbie or similar battery powered devices.</p><p>If nothing comes up, let's move to the next step and run through the packets. The most interesting hint comes from the ICMP port reachable: This message refers to UDP port 137. This port is used for file sharing in Windows-based networks or Linux systems running the Samba service.</p><p>The ICMP port unreachable gives some insight into the device:</p><ul><li>It was never build with security in mind (a reasonable firewall should silently drop the packet)</li><li>It is not a Windows system nor is it a Linux system that is prepared to communicate with a Windows system</li></ul><p>The second point is quite important, as it rules out media players. The new garage door opener after all? (Hint: I would expect that a media player can load video or audio streams from an SMB share).</p><p><strong>Go, get em tiger</strong></p><p>Since your trace file does not give more information it is time to go hunting. Here are a few ideas:</p><ul><li>Fire up Wireshark and capture the whole WiFi traffic. Make sure to capture foreign packets.</li><li>Reboot your access point. This should trigger a reconnection from the mystery device. Most importantly you should see the a series of DHCP requests and responses (at least 2, maybe 4).</li></ul><p>Please post a tracefile that shows these DHCP packets. Here is what I hope to see:</p><ul><li>A host name</li><li>DHCP options that might be used as fingerprint to identify the device</li></ul><p>Hint: You can focus a tracefile on DHCP by using the display filter <strong>bootp</strong></p><p>Wait, there is more. Since this is your network you might want to scan the system: Use the Linux utility nmap with option -O to identify the operating system: <code>nmap -O 192.168.1.35</code> nmap performs a "network finger printing" to identify an operating system.</p><p>Since this is a Wireshark forum we would like to see a trace file of the nmap scan as well. With a bit of luck you will find a web server, an SSL certificate or other information that identifies the device.</p><p><strong>If everything else fails</strong></p><p>Professional WiFi systems use dedicated probes to show fancy heat maps or locate a rogue device. For home and small business networks, you might have an access point that shows the signal strength of all client systems.</p><p>If your system has that feature (and your power cable is long enough) try to walk around your home to pinpoint the location of the device.<br />
</p><p>Good hunting!</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>27 Dec '16, 13:21</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b60e92020a427bb24332efc0b560943?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="packethunter&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>packethunter<br />
