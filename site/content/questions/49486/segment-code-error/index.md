<p>Hello All<br />
I have been using osm for several years and found it to be fantastic, I have got France Spain and Italy on JaVaWa with no problem , When I get the map I use the manual tile selector so there is no overlap in the maps. I am planning a trip to Hungary this summer so need Germany Austria and Hungary , I got Germany ok but Austria and Hungary show up with segment code errors that confict with some that are I France and when I view the maps on my gps All I get Is the base map from the gps on all the conflicting tiles, so my question is - is it possible to fix these segment code errors so I can use all the maps ? I tried the repair function on JaVaWa but it did not work.</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance Tim.</p>

<p>The question seems to be about some proprietary software. Not sure how this is related to OSM and how we are supposed to help.</p>

<p>It's not clear from the question exactly what you did - it just says "segment code errors that confict". That's almost like saying "there's a problem with my car; can you fix it?" without giving any information about the problem.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways of getting maps onto Garmin devices - there are many different download sites, and you can of course generate your own. If you did that with a combined input file containing the data you want I bet you wouldn't get this problem.</p>

<p>The original poster did state the issue but he was not entirely clear about it. Now, he did not say "my car is broken, how do I fix it?" Here's is what he did:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ran the well-known open-source application JaVaWa Device Manager tool that inspects maps on devices</p></li>
<li><p>he got an error on some of the maps stating that there are the same "segment codes" in multiple map files. Specifically, the error is this: "Error: segment codes from this file reside in other files. This will cause problems with routing and/or displaying maps."</p></li>
<li><p>His question is: what does this mean and how to you address it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm here asking the exact same question.</p>

<p>Hello All Having looked at most of the internet it seems that segment code errors cant be fixed all you can do is download the maps on a separate computer and put them on a separate card. Tim.</p>
