There's no evidence of IP Fragmentation occurring or could even occur, considering that "Don't Fragment" is set, and so I think the IP stack is free to reuse the IP ID if it wishes.</p><p>I haven't read the entire RFC (you're certainly free to do so), but from <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6864">RFC 6864</a>:</p><p><code>                     This document deprecates non-fragmentation uses,     allowing the ID to be repeated (within the MDL, within the source     address/destination address/protocol tuple) in those cases.</code></p><p>(MDL is the <em>"maximum datagram lifetime"</em>.)</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Further reading of RFC 6864 makes it clear [to me] that IP ID reuse is permissible. In section 6.1:</p><p><code>    This document changes RFC 791 as follows:    o  IPv4 ID uniqueness applies to only non-atomic datagrams.    o  Retransmitted non-atomic IPv4 datagrams are no longer permitted to       reuse the ID value.</code></p><p>Since all IP datagrams in this capture file are <em>atomic datagrams</em>, IP ID uniqueness doesn't apply. <em>Atomic datagrams</em> is defined in RFC 6864 as follows: "<code>Atomic datagrams are datagrams not yet fragmented and for which further fragmentation has been inhibited.</code>" (In other words, DF=1)</p><p>Regarding frames 2 and 4, this is just an artifact of TCP streaming. There's simply no guarantee that a TCP data segment corresponds in any way with the start of a higher layer PDU. There might be multiple PDUs within a single segment or a partial PDU in one segment followed by the remainder of the PDU in the next or subsequent segments.</p><p>So, when you wrote, <em>"The TCP/IP payload in frame #2 is not the start of a message (i.e., is presumed to be the second IP fragment), as it does not start with this sequence."</em>, this is not accurate. It's presumed not to be the second IP Fragment but the second TCP segment of an upper layer PDU.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>07 Aug '17, 16:07</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/55158e2322c4e365a5e0a4a0ac3fbcef?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="cmaynard&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>cmaynard ♦♦<br />
