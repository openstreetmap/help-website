So much so that I can't enjoy these products. Sometimes their BSSID resolve into straight up IP addresses, for whatever the reason is and I no longer care, for the users here, how do I prevent them using the same tools heshe uses against me to stop them from gaining access. I have to give credit where credit is do, they are intensely skilled. Too bad we won't ever be friends, any suggestions.. they found a way to always connect me to them. You get tired over the years, so I'm reaching out to the community for your advice, the people who actually know what they are talking about. Thanks in advance.
