As the server has a private address while the client has a public one, I assume that there is a port forwarding set up somewhere.</p><p>If my guess is correct, capture <strong>simultaneously</strong> next to the uplink connection to internet (so that you could see whether the packets are missing already at the edge of your company network) and next to the Exchange server. If the packets missing at Exchange side can be found at uplink side, something in your network is dropping them; if they are missing already at the uplink, something outside your network is dropping them.</p></div><div id="comment-64226-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(26 Oct '17, 05:27)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="64227"></span><div id="comment-64227" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-64227-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I think at this point it has to do with the network adapters and Exchange being a VM.

Once again - you have seen from the synchronous captures on the switch and on the Exchange's VM that the packet sent by ProofPoint towards Exchange got lost already before it could arrive to the VMware host.</p><p>A coincidence is not necessarily a correlation - the more that the issue turned out not to be a permanent one but was related to a single message (and, most likely, to a single packet in that message). So it may have nothing to do with VMware or Exchange at all.</p><p>I've read about network cards sensitive about several-byte patterns in packets, causing them to drop such packets (or handle them in a specific way which effectively means a drop).</p></div><div id="comment-64285-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(27 Oct '17, 06:40)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="64290"></span><div id="comment-64290" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-64290-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Because when I look at the PIX logs, as well as the captures. There are resets that are happening...but the traffic still appears to have went to Exchange. But I see resets on the Firewall from outside. U can see in the post I did above that there was a TCP Reset-O</p><p>And we never had this issue when Exchange 2003 was in place....the firewall, and internal network is all the same. Once I decommissioned and removed Exchange 2003, I assigned the Exchange 2003 IP address to Exchange 2010, so all would be the same....just as I will do when I migrate to Exchange 2016.</p><p>I agree with the network card being an issue. This proliant uses Broadcom NICs, which seems to be a card that has issues with Hyper V/VMs But the workarounds are to disable VMQ and some other things which I have done...so while internal traffic transfer to and from Exchange are on par with physical boxes....the translation happening at the Firewall coming in, seem to be having problems. (So yes I would concur it looks to be at the Firewall or on the outside). I just assume it isn't since it was working good before migration.</p></div><div id="comment-64290-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(27 Oct '17, 07:18)</span> sethdunn96</div></div><span id="64292"></span><div id="comment-64292" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-64292-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>In my understanding the tcp reset is just a consequence.

The email appears to get to them fine (clients are not telling us about NDR's being received) and then relayed on to Exchange fine. So that is another reason why I point at Exchange/VM setup.</p></div><div id="comment-64293-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(27 Oct '17, 07:33)</span> sethdunn96</div></div><span id="64294"></span><div id="comment-64294" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-64294-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Funny that we come to completely contradictory conclusions on same input data. For me, the fact that it is better when you let the clients' mail servers talk SMTP directly with your Exchange on VM rather than via ProofPoint's filtering gateway means at first place that the network path from TCP client to TCP server is very likely to differ (as the TCP clients are clients' mailservers at different places across the 'net if you set MX to point to your Exchange), while the last section of that path, the one from your PIX through the VM host to the Exchange VM, is the same in both cases (MX pointing to ProofPoint or MX pointing to the public address of the Exchange directly).</p><p>So for me, the fact that redirecting the SMTP communication to bypass ProofPoint makes things better is an inditia that at least one of possible network paths between ProofPoint and your PIX is ill, while for you it is a proof that the part of the path which is common for both scenarios is ill.</p></div><div id="comment-64294-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(27 Oct '17, 07:49)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="64295"></span><div id="comment-64295" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-64295-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Yeah I see your point and reasoning... I guess I am just coming to the conclusion I am, because when we were on Exchange 2k3, it worked. No issues. No backups/NDR at ProofPoint.

When traffic coming from a ProofPoint server to our exchange server comes through, it has a very odd readout (like what I posted above) vs. email servers contacting our AV Gateway boxes and sending to them. When our AV Gateway boxes are contacted, you can see in the log on the PIX, the inbound connection build, then you will see the connection be tore down (after email has been delivered). I don't see the multiple Deny TCP (no connection) entries for them, like I do for the ProofPoint to Exchange entries.</p></div><div id="comment-64298-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(27 Oct '17, 09:59)</span> sethdunn96</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-64130" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 46 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 41 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-64130-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
