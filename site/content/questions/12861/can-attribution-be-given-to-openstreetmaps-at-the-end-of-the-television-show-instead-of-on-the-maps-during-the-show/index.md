<p>According to our <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Legal_FAQ">Legal FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This credit needs to appear in a place "reasonable to the medium or means you are utilising". In other words, you should expect to credit OpenStreetMap in the same way and with the same prominence as would be expected if you were using any other map supplier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if other comparable mapping data would require an on-screen credit, OpenStreetMap does too. But if the standard in your industry is that the credit appears at the end of the broadcast, that's what OpenStreetMap requires.</p>
<p>Under our future ODbL, the wording is different but the meaning is the same: You are required to include a notice that is "reasonably calculated to make any person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to" the map aware that it is made from OSM.</p>
<p>(That said, a fairly important part of the attribution is getting the name right. We're OpenStreetMap, not OpenStreetMapS!)</p>

<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/5/richard">@Richard</a> <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/104/frederik-ramm">@Frederik</a> Can you clarify again? Our legal FAQ says "For a tv, film or video production, the attribution should typically appear in a corner of the map. As long as the credit is on screen long enough to be read, it does not have to remain in view during panning or zooming. For productions with end credits, we would also welcome a credit there" What the term 'should typically' means? Can I not attribute when the map appears and move it to end credits instead?</p>
