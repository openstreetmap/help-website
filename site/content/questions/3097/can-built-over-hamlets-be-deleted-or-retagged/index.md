<p>The GNIS import of "populated places" left my city peppered with "hamlets" with cute names such as <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=places&amp;lon=-117.76070&amp;lat=33.70768&amp;zoom=15&amp;overlays=megacities,largecities,cities,towns,villages,hamlets,islands,suburbs,farms,localities,municipalities,errors_unknown_place_type,errors_population_format,errors_place_without_name,errors_population_number_format,errors_pop_type_mismatch,population">Kathryn</a> and <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=places&amp;lon=-117.76070&amp;lat=33.70768&amp;zoom=15&amp;overlays=megacities,largecities,cities,towns,villages,hamlets,islands,suburbs,farms,localities,municipalities,errors_unknown_place_type,errors_population_format,errors_place_without_name,errors_population_number_format,errors_pop_type_mismatch,population">Frances</a> that may have existed in the 1970-1980s when they were added to GNIS (see record for <a href="http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:1660825">Kathryn</a>). My city has been growing since it was incorporated in 1971 and these hamlets are now gone, replaced by the newly drawn, master-planned "villages" with flowery names such Northwood, Woodbury and Stonegate, which don't share boundaries or any other features with the historic hamlets, and which I am in the process of mapping.</p>
<p>Since OSM purports to describe "what's there", should I be deleting these hamlets (and maybe other features imported from GNIS) that no longer exist and are not used for identification, reference or any other useful purpose that I can think of?</p>
<p>I don't mind leaving them alone for historic purposes, but I don't want them showing up as "places" on various renders of my area. That causes nothing but confusion. Should I maybe retag them?</p>

<p>If people occasionally refer to the place by its old name, then feel free to tag a place node with 'old_name=Kathryn and Frances' or similar.</p>

<p>They certainly are no longer referred to except in books on the history of California names (and now I know who Kathryn and Frances were!). I don't know if I am doing a bad thing, but I am leaving these nodes, only removing the place=hamlet tag and adding a ref=* tag where I enter the reason this node had been created and the reason I "de-placed" it. I don't like destroying history (but I don't mind altering it).</p>

<p>if the features are not there anymore, please do not hesitate and <em>do</em> delete them. the map is about what is on the ground <em>now</em>, not was has been there some time. having a place on the map that used to be there but is not anymore is a map error - it confuses map users. and don't worry about deleting things - the database keeps history, so if you do something wrong, it can still be recovered.</p>
<p>if a place has only changed name, using "old_name" is a reasonable suggestion.</p>
