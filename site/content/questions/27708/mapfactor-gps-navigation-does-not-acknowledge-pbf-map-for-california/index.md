<p>There's a previous question about Mapfactor <a href="/questions/15836/mapfactor-navigator-11-map-updates">here</a>. I'd be surprised if a it could understand a raw OSM PBF file.</p>
<p>Mapfactor's own forum (where people are more likely to be familiar with the process) is <a href="http://forum.mapfactor.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>May I ask what makes this question 'off topic or irrelevant'? I didn't have a problem downloading Navigator, so to me this was an OpenStreet question.</p>

<p><span>@JohnJ4455</span>: A number of projects download data from planet.openstreetmap.org and use it in their products (which is great - it's what it's there for). However, their software often requires data in a proprietary format in order to update it. The only people who have knowledge of that map format are usually the people who created it, hence why in this case you're more likely to get an answer in Mapfactor's forums rather than here.</p>

<p>Well, I don't know what you guys did, since I didn't do anything to my smartphone since I posted this, but viola...it finally connected, and the pbf files were downloaded to Navigator! Success.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback...</p>
