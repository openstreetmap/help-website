<p>I wrote to the author of this changeset and received a reply. From the reply the edit appears to have been considered and non-mechanical (i.e, the nodes were selected after direct inspection). I have suggested that if they wish to reinstate these edits they should in future contact the community through mail lists etc.</p>

<p>... however given the scope of the edit "considered" here presumably excludes any survey, unless they've been on a significant European castle-hopping trip for the last few months.</p>

<p>The best thing is if you manage to convince the author of the changeset - in a polite and respectful fashion - to revert the changeset himself, or agree to it being reverted.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work then try to involve other project members - bring it up on a suitable mailing list and ask if others think it should be reverted, too. If there's broad agreement, revert.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work or if you believe that this would start an edit war with the person who first did the edit, contact Data Working Group to sort it out.</p>
<p>Having said that, <em>any</em> changeset that bears a comment of (like the one you mentioned) "unification of ... according to wiki best practices" is certainly very problematic; "wiki best practices" must never be a reason to engage in mass retaggings.</p>
