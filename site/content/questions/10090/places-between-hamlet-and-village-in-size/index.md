<p>Definition between 'hamlet' and 'village' can be country specific. In France, an hamlet is max. 100 and 800-900 is diffinitely a village. If locally you call your settlement a 'village', then tag it as a village.</p>

<p>A hamlet is a small place with only a few houses. A place with facilities such as shops, school or church (or the like) makes it a village to me. Sometimes the wiki gets edited by someone with a rather narrow definition. Putting numbers on the size of the settlement seems like that to me, especially as the numbers leave gaps.</p>

<p>I would say generally, use your judgement. Does it feel very small, like a hamlet? If not tag it as a village.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:place">This wiki page</a> gives a slightly different definition from the one you quote:</p>
<p>Hamlet: unincorporated settlement with less than 100 inhabitants.</p>
<p>Village: Major rural settlement as defined by national/state/provincial government. May be an incorporated municipality. Generally smaller than a town, below 10,000 people</p>
<p>So as you can see, the definitions are a little vague, and some judgment is required. The sizes are also qualified on some wiki pages with "May vary by country."</p>

<p>A indian hamlet can be much bigger than a siberian hamlet :) Just yesterday I upgraded a place (ireland, pop 600) from hamlet to village, but YMMV.</p>

<p>The wiki says a town has "more than 1,000 inhabitants, depending on local importance". I would think of a village as something with 1000 or less.</p>
