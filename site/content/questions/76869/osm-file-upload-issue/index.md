<p>Hello, so I'm creating a SketchUp model of a city and have downloaded the .osm file. I also have an extension in SketchUp that will import .osm files. The issue is that I try to import the file and it tells me it was made with a newer version of SketchUp but I have SketchUp 2020. So for anyone that has done this before is there a way to have it save as an older SketchUp file or convert it to something that SketchUp will import even without my extension? I also have access to Revit if that file conversion is easier. Thanks in advance.</p>
