<p>I'm new to OSM. Yesterday, I made several detail changes on the map especially for the landuse of certain areas. I have also drawn new areas to distinguish meadows from farmland. In fact, the changes already show up in the map but only partially at different zoom levels. On a lower zoom level, I can see the entire meadow, if I go nearer, part of the meadow vanishes (and there is farmland instead) and by zooming deeper another time the meadow is back again. Did I draw something wrongfully (overlaps?) to cause this or does this depend on the map renderer?</p>
