<p>It's not a universal problem, because twice I have had it actually work correctly, but I don't know what was different about those times. Are there any workarounds I should know about?</p>
<p>This is with Chrome 22 on MacOS 10.6.4, Flash 11.4.402.287</p>

<p>I've seen this problem as well, although I've also seen keyboard problems with other Flash apps (games etc) in MacOS, and assumed it was just that. I'm also running an older MacOS (10.4!), so I can't definitively answer this.</p>
