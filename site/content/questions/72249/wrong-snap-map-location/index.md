<p>Snap seem to be suggesting via twitter that you contact Mapbox - so perhaps try that?</p>
<p>That said, often the problem with free apps like this is that they show information from a variety of places (in this case there'll be some from Snap itself, some from OSM and some from other data that Mapbox have incorporated into the Map for Snap). It's often not clear to the user what comes from where, so maybe that's a question that you could ask back to Snap?</p>
<p>They may of course reply that it's a free app, and you're therefore not entitled to bugs being fixed, or any support from them - and you are of course able to stop using Snap and start using something else instead.</p>
