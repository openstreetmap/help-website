<p>I'm currently mapping a number of apartment buildings with nonconsecutive unit numbers, e.g. one building has units 7, 8, 15, 16, 23, 24. The next has units 5, 6, 13, 14, 21, 22...</p>
<p>What is the best way to represent these? I've considered using addr:flats since the wiki has an explicit example addressing my use case whereas the addr:unit wiki page does not. However, I just want to make sure since colloquially units are much more commonly used in the US where I'm mapping and flats are not.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you might have to offer.</p>

<p>Tags are usually defined in British English, for historical reasons, so IMHO you shouldn't tag based on what is colloquially used around you, but based on the common (worldwide) documentation that is the wiki.</p>
<p>It's the job of renderers to adapt the technical words of the tags to the relevant language for the user. It is more obvious when the user speak a totally different language, but the same reasoning applies for American English.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>There's probably not a huge semantic difference between addr:flats &amp; addr:unit, but the former is what is commonly used for residential apartments, and the latter for business or retail premises in industrial estates or malls respectively. Typically flats/apartments will be numbered within a building or apartment complex which in turn has an associated addr;street. Industrial &amp; Retail units will often not have a street address, but be more of the form "Unit 123, Burlington Mall, Burlington MA" (a location with both retail &amp; business units).</p>
