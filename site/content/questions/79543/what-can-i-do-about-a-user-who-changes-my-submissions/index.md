<p>For completeness, the DWG is aware of the this dispute. I believe that the questioner here would like to store all trail information in the "name" tag in OSM because the apps they use are not very functional and can't process information in tags other than "name", or relationship memberships.</p>
<p>The "trying to get the data into a form that will render on his own version of OSM" refers to ensuring that route relations are mapped as such, and that tags are used for appropriate way and relation values, rather than shoe-horning everything into "name".</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>first thing is changeset comments. Try to explain your point nicely, and maybe the user will revert his changes, or explain his reasons... If that doesn't work, you can then bring the matter here or on a mailing-list, with relevant details, such as the changeset involved, your efforts to communicate, etc. Then if that doesn't work either, you can bring the matter to the DWG.</p>
<p>About your example, paths seldom have names around here, I don't know for your place. They need to have signs to get the name tag IMHO. Route relations are used to describe hiking routes if necessary.</p>
<p>My 2 cents.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>I find a handful of paths that have names, usually in towns. However much more common though is to add "usually muddy", "narrow and overgrown" type values that should be in the description tag.</p>
