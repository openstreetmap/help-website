</p><ol><li><p>The initial connection often gets stuck in a series of re transmissions after an initial spurious re transmission immediately following the syn/ack. You can see this at the beginning of the trace. This issue is duplicated when I send emails. The initial send hangs until a connection is made.</p></li><li><p>At the end of the trace you can see frame 13198 on the web-server acks's sequence 8040907. However the very next frame again begins another series of re transmissions. You can see the ack for 8040907 on both the web-server and the email server trace I've included below. The acks are getting lost but I'm not sure where. I'm connecting directly from the public ip of the aws web server to the mail server and not through a load balance.I have also opened the inbound ports in the security group to include the port I'm using to connect to email as well as allowing in all ICMP traffic. Would greatly appreciate any insight.</p></li></ol><p>webserver trace 10.2.2.2 <a href="https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/d17da6802b39">https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/d17da6802b39</a></p><p>email server trace 10.1.1.1 <a href="https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/d6c1e750ddf8">https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/d6c1e750ddf8</a></p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">spurious smtp packet tcp retransmissions</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>22 Dec '16, 22:23</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/79f436d0477d16376b0c2cc5d7973b2a?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="vze80&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>vze80<br />

Each instance has a public and a private ip address (each with different MTU). AWS also blocks all inbound ports for all services (including ICMP) unless specifically opened up in the security group (firewall). This could potentially cause problems when the MTU size changes in the network path. (<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/connecting-drop-issues.html).">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/connecting-drop-issues.html).</a> One of the first fixes I tried (before disabling tcp timestamps) was allowing ICMP packets to the client which had no effect. I'm running another capture now. I'll upload shortly.</p></div><div id="comment-58367-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(27 Dec '16, 08:36)</span> vze80</div></div><span id="58374"></span><div id="comment-58374" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-58374-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Successful SMTP/TCP packet capture from client and server</p><p>Mail-Server (10.1.1.1) <a href="https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/b92ad0f5933c">https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/b92ad0f5933c</a></p><p>Mail Client (10.2.2.2) <a href="https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/ca3ef01a45e4">https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/ca3ef01a45e4</a></p><p>Since disabling TCP timestamps on the AWS client all of the SMTP connection and MYSQL connection hangs seem to have been resolved.
