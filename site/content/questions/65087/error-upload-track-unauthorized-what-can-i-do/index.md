<p>Hi,</p>
<p>in the past week or so I recorded a number of tracks with "Locus Map Pro" on Android 7.1 without any problems.</p>
<p>Recording time was between two and five hours.</p>
<p>Today I recorded a nine hour track; when I tried to upload it, all I got was the above error message (in white on orange). There was no "upload failure" email message which might have told me more.</p>
<p>What can I do to get the info contained in that track (106 points) into OSM?</p>
<p>Surely the track can't simply be too long?</p>
<p>Regards, Jochen</p>

<p>In case something was wrong with the network connection or when the server was down, it's pretty hard to send an email. I admit that Locus Map Pro could have been more informative, but on the other side they do not necessarily know more.</p>
<p>Maybe you should just try again now ? It could have been a hickup that is fixed in the meantime.</p>

<p>I ried again around midnight, and just now.</p>
<p>Same result.</p>
<p>To see if it was something about this particular track I tried uploading a short track that I had not uploaded before simply because it contained only one info relevant to OSM - same result.</p>
<p>I tapped "Remove Login" in Locus' Export dialogue, logged in again to OSM, making sure that Locus had all permissions necessary for upload granted - same result.</p>

<p>Thanks - this worked (at least I am now "waiting" rather than "Unauthorized"); the rest, I hope, the Locus forum will deal with.</p>
