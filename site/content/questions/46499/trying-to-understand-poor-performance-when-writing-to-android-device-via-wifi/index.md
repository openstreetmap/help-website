If so, sorry for the confusion - as I said the first time my knowledge of TCP is not good.</p><p>The situation is still this: When I write PC-to-PC I get around 10 MB per second. Android device on WiFi to PC is about half that, and that's OK. But when I try sending from PC to the Android device the transmission rate is down below 1/2 MB per second, which is not good.</p><p>I'm trying to use Wireshark to see if it can tell me why this is. Here are two Wireshark captures:</p><p><a href="https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/7133e5f96577">https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/7133e5f96577</a></p><p><a href="https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/47ff5505d1e1">https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/47ff5505d1e1</a></p><p>As far as I can see the big difference is that in the PC-to-PC version I'm sending 5 KB and 15 KB packets every 1 ms., while in the PC-to-Android version I'm sending typically 1.5 KB packets every 2 ms.</p><p>Is this because the WiFi router (a SonicWall firewall / WiFi router) is telling my PC it doesn't want more data? It does specify an initial window size of only 8 KB, but after that it typically indicates a window size of around 30 KB. Is it the low initial window size that's the problem? Or something else? And is there anything I can do to improve this performance?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">performance wifi</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>13 Oct '15, 06:50</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cefa500b666d789893f89cae377b7e76?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="RenniePet&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>RenniePet<br />

Them sort from highest to lowest in the Delta time column. In the PC-to-PC capture, the largest time delta is about 12.5msec and this occurs at the beginning of the data transfer. However, in the PC-to-Android capture, there are multiple instances in which the time delta between frames is around 300msec! In fact, there are 67 instances in which the time delta between frames exceeds 250msec (67 * 0.25sec = 16.75sec in which no data is being transferred between endpoints - no wonder your throughput suffers).</p><p>What is even more interesting, is that the following occurs:</p><ol><li>The Android device (172.16.31.178) sends a TCP Window Update to the PC (10.2.2.20)</li><li>The PC (10.2.2.20) waits around 300msec and then retransmits the previous TCP segment</li><li>The Android device ACK's the retransmission and the transfer continues</li></ol><p>This appears to be an issue at a lower layer - maybe WiFi issues?</p><p>Can you post a capture which includes all the data (no filters and make sure to include the WiFi frames)?

I thought you were capturing over WiFi.

So I have additional questions: 1. Is the PC-to-PC transfer also made over WiFi? 2. You also mentioned that Android-to-PC transfer speeds is OK, but PC-to-Android is not. Are you using the same PC to send and receive data in these tests? 3. In your PC-to-PC tests, do you use the same PC as the previous testing?

Amato_C's suggestion of creating a column showing DeltaTime was very revealing.</p><p>Things start off running fairly OK except that the Android device keeps reporting a larger and larger window size, until it hits what is apparently its limit at 522176 bytes (1/2 MB!) around packet number 658. Then it starts sending [TCP Window Update] packets at packet number 698. Then everything goes horribly wrong, with long delays of approx. 300 ms. again and again.</p><p>So then I realize that the problem is presumably something as banal as my Android app not being able to process the incoming messages as fast as they're arriving, so the input buffer fills up. I've tried running a cpu profiler (Google's Traceview), and if I'm interpreting the results correctly, the Android device is running with 100% cpu time, partly in my app, partly in Java NIO, partly doing garbage collection, plus some other minor things.</p><p>I'll change my test programs (PC and Android) to use fewer and larger messages, and see if that doesn't fix, or at least significantly alleviate, the performance problem.</p></div><div id="comment-46543-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(13 Oct '15, 20:46)</span> RenniePet</div></div><span id="46554"></span><div id="comment-46554" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-46554-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Amato_C: First off, sorry for not having seen the comment you posted yesterday, before I posted my last comment.</p><p>And thank you very much for your time.</p><p>This is driving me CRAZY.</p><p>I changed my test programs, and now the Android app is not cpu-bound, and it no longer reports increasing window size in the ACKs - the window size now varies between 25 and 29 KB.</p><p>But the performance problem remains.
