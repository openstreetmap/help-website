Also bear in mind that the <code>ip.id</code> is originally used to link together packet fragments, so you'll need to define a rule to ignore false positives (second and higher segments of the same packet are not looped but the <code>ip.src, ip.dst, ip.id</code> is the same for them).</p></div><div id="comment-56095-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 Oct '16, 07:05)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div><span id="56101"></span><div id="comment-56101" class="comment"><div id="post-56101-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>It's common to have layer 2 traffic (i.e. ARP) causing the loop as well, as some of it is broadcast. ip.id won't match in this case as there is no IP header. For this, I look for very rapid broadcast ARP requests for the same or same set of IP addresses.</p><p>I suspect loops when I get a sudden increase in traffic from the network management system which tends to be a step change in throughput. It is then proveable from a packet capture using techniques like you suggest, and also some others when dealing with layer 2 traffic.</p></div><div id="comment-56101-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 Oct '16, 10:00)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Bob Jones</span></div></div><span id="56102"></span><div id="comment-56102" class="comment"><div id="post-56102-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I think editcap uses a hash checksum for the entire frame to detect duplicate packets.</p><p>During a loop I think you will only see Broadcasts or packets that are flooded, due to the learning phase of a switch.</p></div><div id="comment-56102-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(03 Oct '16, 10:23)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Christian_R</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-56086" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-56086-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
