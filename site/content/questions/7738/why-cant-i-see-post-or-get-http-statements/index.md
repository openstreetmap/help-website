If not, then you're not going to see its traffic on the Windows 7 PC - that PC will only see traffic that's sent into the hub; it won't magically see traffic that's sent through the BT router unless the router sends it to the hub. The Windows 7 PC will only be able to see broadcast and multicast traffic and unicast traffic to and from machines plugged into the hub. (Note, BTW, that TCP traffic, which includes most HTTP traffic, is <em>NOT</em> broadcast traffic!)</p></div><div id="comment-7792-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(06 Dec '11, 01:42)</span> Guy Harris ♦♦</div></div><span id="9078"></span><div id="comment-9078" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-9078-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Hi,</p><p>I have the same problem, i am not able to view HTTP GET &amp; POST messages on my Windows 7 laptop in wireshark.</p><p>Did you find any solution, please let me know if you have any information to get to see these messages on wireshark.</p><p>I am connected to my home WIFI and using Microsoft Interface from my system.</p><p>Thanks in advance :)</p></div><div id="comment-9078-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(16 Feb '12, 15:58)</span> wired123</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-7738" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 7 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 2 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-7738-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
