<p>I was wondering if anyone could help me solve a problem. At some point in the last few weeks the water (bay) area has been disappearing from the following area. <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=26.441774368286133&amp;lon=-81.88591003417969&amp;zoom=13">http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=26.441774368286133&amp;lon=-81.88591003417969&amp;zoom=13</a> . I don't know if I did this inadvertently or someone else. I do make a lot of edits in Lee County, FL. I cannot figure out what is wrong or how to get it back. Thanks for any advice or help you can give me.</p>

<p>I had a look at the data. I found a lot of connected waysegments with natural=water enclosing the bay. As far as I know such a thing would not be rendered as water (contrary to natural=coastline). Interesting there should have been water rendered at all.</p>
<p>I have been so bold and put these segments into a multipolygon and added all the inner natural=land to it, too.</p>
<p>Still there is some work to do. Some of the ways are not too exact and one long way in that region misses tags at all. And several islands are not mapped, but doing that will be quite some work.<br />
Having mentioned that, the rest of the region looks good to me as far as I looked. :)</p>

<p>Thanks for the help. I am totally redoing the area. There wwas just too many messed up areas and the behavior of some of the lines/nodes were unexplainable and as far as I could figure out unfixable. The area will be much nicer and "cleaner" when I am done with it.</p>
