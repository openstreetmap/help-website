You could add it as a label with the individual values below it as a subtree. When viewing packets from your protocol you don't need to expand the subtree to see the data values you need.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>03 Jul '13, 05:44</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d2a7e24ca66604c749c7c88c1da8ff78?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="grahamb&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>grahamb ♦</span><br />

Please read the FAQ for more information.</p><p>As mentioned above, for all the years I've been working on Wireshark, I've never used Visual Studio for debugging, I've used WinDbg.</p><p>After your question though, I tried VS 2010 Express and to my surprise it all worked, I could set a breakpoint in my dissector, and when the breakpoint was hit, could step through and VS would open the appropriate source files as required.</p><p>How I did this:</p><ol><li>Built Wireshark in the usual manner using nmake.</li><li>Open VS2010EE and from the File | Open | Project/Solution dialog selected Wireshark.exe from the wireshark-gtk2 directory created by the build.</li><li>Right click the Solution 'Wireshark' (1 project) item in Solution Explorer and select Properties from the menu.</li><li>Under Common Properties | Debug Source Files added an entry pointing to the top of my Wireshark source tree.</li><li>Opened the source file for my dissector using File | Open | File.</li><li>Placed a breakpoint in my main dissector function.</li><li>Started debugging using Debug | Start Debugging.</li><li>When VS finished loading all the symbols* it could obtain, from Wireshark loaded a capture with traffic for my dissector.</li><li>Bingo, breakpoint hit. I can step and inspect values as required.</li></ol><p>*I may, in the past, have modified the VS defaults for symbols. Currently, under Tools | Options | Debugging Symbols, I have a single entry for "Microsoft Symbol Servers", and a local directory to cache the symbols in. You'll need a working internet connection to cache the symbols the first time you start a debugging session, and it may take some time to download the symbol files so the first start may be slow. Check the "Output" window in VS to see the progress of loading the symbols. Subsequent runs (if the symbols are cached) are much quicker to load.</p><p>Note that this setup doesn't give you symbol cross-references, that is done by creating the .sbr files during the build as discussed in the other question I linked to.</p></div><div id="comment-22632-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(04 Jul '13, 01:31)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">grahamb ♦</span></div></div><span id="23047"></span><div id="comment-23047" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-23047-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p><span>@Johnny321</span>: If a supplied answer resolves your question can you please "accept" it by clicking the checkmark icon next to it.
