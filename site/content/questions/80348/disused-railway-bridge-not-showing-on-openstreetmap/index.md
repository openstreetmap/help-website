Not sure whether above link is what you require as still very much a novice! The bridge now shows up at certain zoom levels so maybe I was a little impatient. I did wait an hour or so before asking the question as nothing had changed. The bridge is to the left of Langley Green railway station.</p>

<p>There are two things you can do to model bridges. The standard one is to model a highway or railway and add a tag bridge=yes. That is probably what has been done in your case.</p>
<p>The other way is mapping the bridge structure itself by <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:man_made%3Dbridge"><code>man_made=bridge</code></a>. The bridge gets modeled additionally to the highway or railway. In many cases mapping the <code>man_made=bridge</code> is omitted but in your case where the railway is razed but the bridge itself not it makes sense to map it. Have a look at the linked wiki page and hwo to do it.</p>
<p>If you share the link to the bridge in question we can also have a look if something else needs to be considered.</p>

<p>(as a couple of other people have already said) you need to map the bridge structure itself by <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:man_made%3Dbridge">man_made=bridge</a>. Draw the bridge structure (not the rails) like <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/656183412">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/656183412</a> .</p>

<p>It looks almost good now. A few hints, tough:</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:man_made%3Dbridge#Tagging">Common practice is to connect the outline of the bridge and the end points of the railway lines running over it with a shared node</a>.</p>
<p>You have connected the north-western corner of the bridge to a fence which is likely running under the bridge (not visible on the aerials). Likewise you have connected the south-western corner with a fence and a landuse area. This is generally not recommended. You can unconnect the objects by right-clicking on the connected nodes and chose the proper option.</p>
<p>I presume the bridge is pretty much a rectangle in reality. You can right-click on the bridge outline and chose to rectify the angles.</p>
<p>But don't worry. We have all started like this. Once you get the hang of editing it will get much easier and you have to watch out to not getting addicted. :-)</p>

<p>Ah I think I see. When I disconnected the fence node etc I noticed the node colour changed from grey to white. As the 4 nodes on the railway tracks were coloured grey I assumed they had connected sort of automatically when I ran the bridge area line through them. Presumably, these 4 nodes were already coloured grey from joining what was originally the abandoned railway track to the bridge. However, additional connections were required to the Bridge Area (which you have done). Please feel free to correct me if I've misunderstood.</p>

<p>You should use <code>railway=disused</code> for rails remaining on top of the trackbed, which is indeed rendered by the OSM Carto style used in the Standard Tile Layer. The "bridge" deck structure itself can be represented by a <code>man_made=bridge</code>.</p>
<p><code>railway=abandoned</code> is for removed rails with supporting structure remaining, only rendered by OpenRailwayMap.</p>

<p>All what you state is correct. Naughty me! I made a bit of a hash as I tried to put a bridge deck in but failed and I think only saved part (through inexperience, I hasten to add). There is just a single bridge - no gap in the middle of the rails so views incorrectly on your map <a href="https://map.atownsend.org.uk/maps/map/map.html#zoom=21&amp;lat=52.4936983&amp;lon=-2.0079356">https://map.atownsend.org.uk/maps/map/map.html#zoom=21&amp;lat=52.4936983&amp;lon=-2.0079356</a></p>

<p>Don’t bother/try to make a disused item “show up on OpenStreetMap”. The rendering on the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">main OSM website</a> does not and cannot show everything in the map database.</p>
<p>If properly tagged, I believe that disused railways will show up on the <a href="https://www.openrailwaymap.org">Open Railway Map</a>.</p>
<p>If you really, really want or need to have disused infrastructure to show up on the main OSM website then a bug report (or probably better a tested change and pull request) to the style maintainers would be the way to go. But don’t be surprised if the request is not implemented: No map can show everything and still be readable so the maintainers have to balance all the conflicting possibilities and may decide that display of disused railway bridges are not important to enough users.</p>

<p>To #stf - Thanks for replying. I did think it relevant to show the bridge as people walking the towpath and canal boats do pass under and it seemed an inaccuracy to leave it off the map. The bridge does show on the latest Ordnance Survey map.</p>
