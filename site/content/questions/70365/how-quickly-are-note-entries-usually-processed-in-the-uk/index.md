<p>Following on from my previous question, I have searched through various Help and Wiki pages and I think that I understand that there are two common options to ask somebody else to edit a map on my behalf.</p>
<p>I can add a Note to a location, and explain what the issue is (in my opinion).</p>
<p>I can add a "fixme" tag with a similar explanation (but I am not yet clear if there is an easy way to add such a tag when using Android, which appears to severely limit the editing capabilities).</p>
<p>I think that I have read that "fixme" tags are likely to be picked up quickly by the developer tools, but I can't find any reference/explanation on how often Notes are reviewed and how long it usually takes from posting a Note to a map edit happening.</p>
<p>I am holding off on posting Notes until I understand how effective a method this is to get a change applied to the map.</p>

<p>The best &amp; quickest way to improve the quality of OSM is to edit it oneself. iD editor has some useful 'getting started' tutorials.</p>
<p>If you do need to add a note, please position it as accurately as possible &amp; type a clear message of what the problem is. These are things which are lacking in so many apps.</p>

<p>Just coming back to this several years later. I have added two notes to the map (one at each end of a diversion) but I see that I need to add photos as well.</p>
<p>I have briefly looked at Mapillary and it is another process to learn!</p>
<p>I think the main mental leap will be associating a photo (either directly from the phone or via Mapillary) with my Notes.</p>

<p>You don't <em>need</em> to add photos (in fact OpenStreetMap has no storage for photos). You just need to edit the map yourself!</p>

<p>My reading so far suggests that the easiest way to dip a toe into updating the map is to leave a Note, which effectively asks someone who knows how to edit to make the changes.</p>
<p>Further reading suggests that a mapper won't update from a Note without pictures to verify the information or without going to the location themselves to confirm the accuracy of the Note.</p>
<p>This seems reasonable to avoid false information being added by malicious (or incompetent) contributors.</p>

<p>There is no fixed time period. As for most things OSM <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Notes">notes</a> are generally handled by volunteers, when they get around to them.</p>
<p>For a major, easily fixed problem in an area with many mappers it could be fixed in minutes. For a vague or fiddly problem elsewhere, it may be there for years.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:fixme">fixme</a> tags are more for mapper to mapper communication, they may also be around for years, but can be useful.</p>
<p>Actual edits are incorporated as soon as they are uploaded.</p>

<p>IMHO, it also depends on the trustworthiness. A note posted under a name (not anonymous), with a link to a photo (Mapillary/OSC,etc.) or article helps. When such information is missing, a mapper should verify the note in the field before trusting the (anonymous) notes. This takes longer.</p>
