<p>Hello Openstreetmap.org,</p>
<p>I'm a member of you. I also use your openmap. It's really good for developer and also include me. But I see an incorect information on your map that is "U-shaped line" you show that belongs to China. That is not true. So could you please remove it. And also the information about the Paracel Islands is not correct too. That's Island belongs to Vietnam. Chinese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Paracel_Islands">Occupied on January 19, 1974</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>

<p>The island groups that you mention are disputed by a number of different states in the region. In cases like this, there's unlikely to be a suitable answer that's acceptable to all claimants.</p>
<p>An overview of the way that OpenStreetMap deals with disputes is described on <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Disputes">this wiki page</a>. The normal way of resolving is the "on the ground" rule - "whatever name, designation, etc are used by the people on the ground at that location are used in the non-localized tags". Unfortunately in sparsely- or non-populated areas that's difficult to apply.</p>
<p>Although a number of individual edits have been made in this area (and then changed by others of different political persuations), this isn't likely to provide a solution that all parties agree on - mediation via the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Data_working_group">Data Working Group</a> is likely to provide a better way forward.</p>
<p>This help site really isn't the place to resolve issues of this nature.</p>
