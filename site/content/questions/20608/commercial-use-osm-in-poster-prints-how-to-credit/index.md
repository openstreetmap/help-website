<p>I’m planning to (commercially) use OSM data in a series of poster prints. In short: the OSM data forms the basis of the prints, however this data is stylized into an artistic and visual appealing way. These poster-prints will be offered on a website.</p>
<p>I don’t want to inflict any copyrights or run into legal issues later on. Moreover, the most recent question (<a href="/questions/10875/commercial-use-of-stylized-data-in-prints)">https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/10875/commercial-use-of-stylized-data-in-prints)</a> on this subject has been answered more than a year ago, so maybe some legal things have changed since then. I searched through many FAQ's but cannot find an answer to this particular issue so hereby the following question:</p>
<p>Will it be sufficient to state on the website were the prints are being sold the following sentence: <em>“These prints based upon the data and maps of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>. The data is available under the Open Data Commons Open Database License (<a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">ODbL</a>) and the cartography is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>). See: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright”.">https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright”.</a></em></p>
<p>Or is it necessary to print above sentence on the posters itself and/or as a physical handout that comes with the print?</p>

<p>IANAL, but my guess would be that the copyright notice will have to be on the poster itself, or in the legend.</p>
<p>You will not get a legally binding statement on here, though, and should probably ask a lawyer specialized in copyright.</p>

<p>We do not dispense legal advice here. However your case seems to be reasonably simple as described and you should be able to form your own opnion from the material available.</p>
<p>Our attribution requirements and general licence information can be found here: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright</a> as you already mention.</p>
<p>Attribution should clearly be on a suitable place on the posters themselves. From your question it would seem as if you are not using map tiles generated by "OSM", so in my opinion there is no need to reference the cartography in your text. Assuming you do not use modified OSM data (a derivitive database) that is likely to be all that you need to do.</p>
