I assumed something of the sort but this is not the context I was looking for or I may not have explained what is my position in all this: I got curious about the defaced webpage on a hacked server because the webpage plays a background music and I wondered about the music's IP origin. I then pulled a copy of the defaced webpage to my virtual machine. I opened the webpage and sniffed the request packets. I do not own or have access to the target IP from which the music / Flash SWF is loaded but I am interested in finding out the full exact URL to it. About the target server being prone to directory traversal, I agree and it would also be logical to assume that the hackers who defaced other servers used other hacked servers to maintain their content and not their own servers/computers. Still, since I get the HTTP request URI like this:<br />
</p><p>Request URI: /.../My_flash.swf?soundswf=http://192.168.20.55/.../flash.swf&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loops=1</p><p>My question still maintains, if it's even answerable...<br />
Is there any possible way to decode the final URL result without internal access to the remote server?</p><p>Thanks for the help!</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags"><span class="post-tag tag-link-http" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;http&#39;">http</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-problem" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;problem&#39;">problem</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-request" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;request&#39;">request</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-uri" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;uri&#39;">uri</span></div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>21 Jun '11, 17:20</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bf61848ac0ec0d9323f1a1bfbbec1edd?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="ner0&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>ner0</span><br />

Note that the 3 dots refer to a directory. This directory would not show in the output of the regular <strong>ls</strong> command, use <strong>ls -a</strong> to find the directory. If ls -a does not show the files you might have a root kit at work that keeps the directory hidden from all users.</p><p>Everything that follows the questionmark is a parameter to be processed by the script running on the web server.

There's nothing really wrong or odd about the URI, it's a plain directory traversal method, which means that the target server is that unsecure.

I already contacted the hosting services where the content is located so that they can look into it.
