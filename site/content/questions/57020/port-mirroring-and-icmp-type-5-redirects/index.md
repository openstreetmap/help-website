Or its better to capture SIP traffic on one NIC, and browse the web via another NIC installed on the same PC?</p></blockquote><p>The way port monitoring works on most switches, it is not possible to use the PC's NIC connected to a monitoring port to connect the PC to the network, at least because the ingress direction of a monitoring port is disabled. Therefore, the port cannot forward even the NIC's ARP responses to their destinations.</p><p>If your PC can browse the web while connected to a monitoring port of a switch and there is no other wired or wireless NIC active, either the implementation of monitoring on that switch is really unusual or the configuration is wrong. I don't have GS105Ev2 yet, but <a href="https://ask.wireshark.org/questions/56797/capturing-packets-with-a-netgear-gs105ev2">this question</a> suggests that the manual may not be really clear, so please double-check your settings.</p><blockquote><p>In this case, how to assign NICs priority correctly?</p></blockquote><p>There's nothing as sophisticated as priority here. At the NIC you want to use for monitoring, you either disable IP (both v4 and v6) and, eventually, also other L3 protocols on that NIC. If DHCP client mode is normally configured on the NIC, you don't need to do anything at all. The key is to make the NIC not applicable for the network stack, and the NIC cannot ever get a DHCP offer through a monitoring port of a switch (unless the monitoring behaves really unusually as described above).</p><blockquote><p>I tried blocking ICMP Redirects by Firewall, but they are still generated and saturate the link.</p></blockquote><p>If you have in mind the Windows firewall, the icmp packets are generated between the firewall and the NIC, so the firewall cannot block them.</p><blockquote><p>What version would you recommend for Win10 64-bit PC, and why?</p></blockquote><p>WinPcap 4.1.3 is supported by the Wireshark project, Win10Pcap is not. On top of the two, there is also NPcap from the NMap project, which is an experimental development supported by Wireshark project. For your purpose, none of them has any clear advantage over the remaining two. The capturing filter is not related to generation of ICMP redirects.</p><blockquote><p>Is it a typical situation, when a mirrored traffic generates DDoS flow of ICMP Redirect packets from OS TCP Stack?</p></blockquote><p>Slightly off-topic, the first D in DDoS is "distributed", which is clearly not the case here. To the matter, of course it is not a typical behaviour - normally a network stack sends ICMP Redirect packets only if it is configured as a gateway but cannot deliver the received packet to the destination. So to trigger an ICMP redirect packet, an incoming packet should have a destination MAC address of your PC and destination IP address of some other host.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>06 Nov '16, 01:15</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/00fc6e2633725bd871ff636f0175eabc?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="sindy&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>sindy<br />

When you start capturing, this filter is deactivated, so all frames are let in. This is called "promiscuous mode" and is necessary to allow capturing of 3rd party traffic such as your VoIP phone's one. You can disable promiscuous mode in the NIC settings in Wireshark before starting to capture to check whether it is the reason.</p><p>It seems that the IP stack doesn't check the destination MAC address, assuming that only valid frames can reach it, so it only looks at the destination IP address and as it is not its own and the NIC through which it would route to that destination IP would be the same one through which the packet came in, it generates the ICMP redirect.</p><p>But the decision criteria may be different, so even if the packet would be forwarded using another NIC, the ICMP redirect may still be sent. Can you confirm that if you use the NIC deactivation methods suggested (disable protocols or activate DHCP client mode) on the NIC you use for monitoring, the ICMP redirect issue disappears?</p><blockquote><p>Can these ICMP packets be generated by a NIC card, not Windows TCP stack?

My assumption is that different behaviour of the distinct NIC drivers in promiscuous mode or different L3 configuration of the distinct NICs explains the difference in sending of ICMP redirect.</p></div><div id="comment-57041-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(07 Nov '16, 01:03)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="57074"></span><div id="comment-57074" class="comment"><div id="post-57074-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Hi sindy,</p><p>I'm still testing another NIC, the delay is caused by my VoIP phone couldn't register any longer with the provider due to frequent changes on the LAN segment. :)</p><p>Your input is very useful for many folks, since it uncovers more depth about port mirroring and packet interaction with various hardware and OS components.

What settings do you mean? Each NIC has usual Advanced Settings choice in Properties.</p></blockquote><p>L3 means Layer 3 which can be simplified to "any protocol which uses the Ethernet as transport". The ICMP redirect is solely an issue of the IP, while L3 stacks other than IP may exhibit similar issues following their own house rules.</p><p>So what I had in mind was that the (IP address; subnet mask; gateway) settings of the interfaces together with the routing settings. My experience is that the gateway item should be defined only for one NIC per system because it is copied to the routing table as the default route each time the NIC goes up, which means that the last NIC to be connected to the network wins.</p><p>I guess there is no point looking for anything in the <code>Advanced Settings</code> of the network card as I don't believe anyone would make the check of the destination MAC address a configurable item. Checking it is normally useless as the hardware filter on the NIC prevents such frames from getting in, and as it costs some CPU cycles, I guess most drivers don't do it at all.</p><p>I'm not even 100% sure whether there actually is some NIC type dependent code which could do the MAC address check between the place where WinPcap's packet "filter" is inserted and the bottom of the IP stack.</p><blockquote><p>Which typical NIC settings may positively affect the VoIP capture task?</p></blockquote><p>There's nothing special about VoIP versus other types of traffic in this regard. You'd get the same issue with any other IP traffic, like e.g. a browser access to your phone's web interface.</p></div><div id="comment-57082-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(07 Nov '16, 10:35)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="57083"></span><div id="comment-57083" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-57083-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>As well, GS105E switch has the ability to create port based VLANs, but not LAGs, does it mean its L3 configurable?</p></blockquote><p>VLANs are considered part of L2, and so are LAGs (although most LAG implementations can use L3 addresses to spread the load among the LAG member links, but that's far away from the original topic).</p><blockquote><p>Can creating a separate VLAN on the mirroring port 2 help in eliminating ICMP Redirects, and why?</p></blockquote><p>That's also more complex than it seems.</p><p>First, many Windows NIC drivers strip away any VLAN headers before letting the frame in (rather than ignoring the frame completely), and only some of them allow to change this in the <code>Advanced Settings</code>.</p><p>Second, advanced implementations of port mirroring usually permit to mirror to a port</p><ul><li><p>the complete traffic of a (direction of a) source port, regardless to how many VLANs the source port belongs, which means that any VLAN tags are kept as they are, or</p></li><li><p>the a complete traffic of a VLAN, regardless how many member ports it has, which may cause bandwidth issues (this type of traffic mirroring is not possible with the GS105Ev2),</p></li></ul><p>but I have never seen an implementation which would add VLAN tags to the monitored traffic at the egress of the monitoring port as there are no use cases for such behaviour (other than the one you've just suggested).

Switches like GS105E are consumer+ grade, and widely used to analyze and capture mirrored network traffic like VoIP using Wireshark or similar tool on a Windows PC. If passing such mirrored traffic in promiscuous mode would inevitably result in ICMP Redirects generated by TCP stack that flood the network segment, such capture would not be generally possible, and therefore use of the mirror switch. But reports like mine aren't widespread on the web. This means, standard ways exist to bypass this stack assumed behavior and successfully capture mirrored traffic.

Do you <strong>suppose</strong> or <strong>know</strong> that the switch forwards the ICMP redirection packets sent by the capturing NIC further to the network?</p><h3 id="affection-of-the-contents-of-the-capture-file">Affection of the contents of the capture file</h3><p>have you tried, on the NIC used for capturing, to</p><ul><li><p>disable IP protocol completely, or</p></li><li><p>configure the IP protocol for DHCP client mode, or</p></li><li><p>statically configure an IP from another subnet than the one you are monitoring</p></li></ul><p>and capture again? The ICMP redirect <strong>should</strong> only be sent if the destination IP address of the triggering received packet is from the same IP subnet like the IP address of the receiving (in our case, capturing) NIC; in worst case, if it is from the same IP subnet like the IP address of <strong>any</strong> of the active NICs on the receiving PC. So to avoid the problem, it should be enough to avoid capturing a subnet which is at the same time active at the capturing NIC or, in worst case, at any of the capturing PC's NICs.</p><p>Besides, as the mirroring port normally comes up in full duplex mode, the ICMP redirect packets do not reduce the amount of the monitored traffic as long as the network stack can deal with it, so you can easily filter them out from the capture using a display filter, and maybe even a capture filter could be composed.</p></div><div id="comment-57091-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(07 Nov '16, 13:18)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="57105"></span><div id="comment-57105" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-57105-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>There are couple of issues here.

But if you use DHCP client mode on that interface when using it for normal network connections, the advantage is that you don't have to do anything at all when connecting it to a mirroring port instead. But that is true only if the mirroring port works the usual way; if it lets through regular traffic on top of mirroring another port's traffic, the DHCP negotiation can take place and so the DHCP client mode doesn't prevent all those bad things from happening. So only disabling IP completely on the capturing NIC can sort this out.</p><blockquote><p>Netgear support advised to attempt capture mirrored traffic and browse the web through the same NIC, despite I initially channeled the traffic through 2 different NICs (prior to your config suggestions, so both were DHCP).</p></blockquote><p>If Netgear support says that the mirroring port can be used to connect the PC to the network, it means that their idea of how the traffic mirroring port should behave really differs from the common one. Weird. Maybe they wanted to emulate the behaviour of a plain hub? I was going to buy one once I've noticed its existence from the questions here, but this information makes me think one more time whether it is a good idea. @Bob Jones, as you have got many of them, can you confirm that the port configured as mirroring destination can still be used for normal traffic?</p><p>I don't understand what you mean by channelling traffic through 2 NICs, was it a port channel (LAG) or did you have in mind something else?

Two out of four streams were showing 8.3 % packet loss and some sane number of lost packets, and the other two were showing 1,800,000 % (yes, one and something million percent) packet loss and something like 2^32 lost packets. The indicated loss ratio depended on direction.</p><p>So I've applied a display filter to choose just one of the "8.3%" streams and used <code>Telephony -&gt; RTP -&gt; Stream Analysis</code>, and there was 0% loss in the analysis; then I've chosen a stream in the opposite direction, and there was 0% loss as well.</p><p>And after choosing <code>Telephony -&gt; RTP -&gt; RTP streams</code>, there was 0% loss shown for all streams.</p><p>So you should try the same with your "lossy" captures to find out whether it is a capturing issue or a dissection issue. The 25 Mbit/s absolute maximum of download speed of your uplink is 40 times less than the 1 Gbit/s bandwidth of the Ethernet, so there is no reason for the mirrored packets to not fit into the wire - except if they wouldn't be buffered at all as outlined earlier.</p><p>I just have no idea how to file this as a bug as when I save the capture, close Wirehark, and open the file again, the first <code>Telephony -&gt; RTP -&gt; RTP streams</code> shows correct results (leaving aside that the capture file has 13 MB zipped).</p></div><div id="comment-57267-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(10 Nov '16, 06:25)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="57482"></span><div id="comment-57482" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-57482-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Likely, the switch would pass all VoIP traffic available, but the internet upload speed seems to be a limiting factor in sending VoIP packets out, so some are dropped when PC plays YouTube HR video, since heavy downloads are often accompanied by upload "received confirmation" or "request next" packets, or opposite traffic in P2P applications.</p></div><div id="comment-57482-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(20 Nov '16, 07:22)</span> zamar24</div></div><span id="57484"></span><div id="comment-57484" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-57484-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>The internet uplink speed may be a limiting factor but it is not the case of missing CPE-&gt;internet packets in the capture - these packets would be dropped later at the modem's uplink interface, not already at the switch, so you would still see them in the capture. The downlink direction is a different case.</p><p>And in my case, there was almost no other traffic than those two bidirectional RTP streams, and still the first analysis of Wireshark in <code>RTP -&gt; Show All Streams</code> was reporting losses; the next analysis of the same capture by the same run of Wireshark, i.e. without saving the file, restarting Wireshark, was correct. And so was the first analysis of the saved file by a new run of Wireshark.</p><p>So what I was trying to tell you was that you should try to capture the RTP again while playing the video, but to run the RTP analysis more than once.</p></div><div id="comment-57484-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(20 Nov '16, 08:02)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="57485"></span><div id="comment-57485" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-57485-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I will definitely try that.

I do netcat or something on that port and pipe to /dev/null to avoid this, but these are usually not redirects, though they are ICMP.</p><p>If you are generating redirects I would think you have routing enabled in your stack. Can you try disabling it if you have it enabled? I have those switches with mirror ports configured (they are very inexpensive and I have many of them to support my colleagues when they need to do packet capture on their development systems) and have no issue such as this. you didn't post a trace so we can't check, but what is the source address of the redirects? That will give you some clues as to the interface that is generating them.</p><p>I don't know what OS you are using, but you mention Windows components so I assume it is some Windows variant. Windows can route, even the regular non-server OSs, but it requires a registry change.

WCS is basically a router with a DHCP server on NICs chosen to be LAN interfaces and NAT on the NIC chosen to act as WAN interface.</p><p>As for the capturing quality: I'd assume the choice of mode (i.e. whether the NIC connected to the monitoring port also carries own traffic of the PC or not) affects the quality of capturing mirrored data rather than the choice of a particular NIC.</p><p>Example of port occupation: 1 - IP phone 2 - capturing PC's "shared mode" NIC 3 - another local PC 4 - unused 5 - WAN uplink</p><p>In this case, if the IP phone talks to the VoIP service via the WAN port and the capturing PC downloads a file from another local PC, using almost the full bandwidth of the port, it is no wonder that the other 5-&gt;1 traffic doesn't fit well into that bandwidth even if the mirroring can buffer frames and send them when the line is free.</p><p>If there is no buffering and the mirrored frames are only sent via the mirroring port when no own traffic frame is currently being sent on it, and get dropped otherwise, running the NIC in shared mode causes random loss of the mirrored frames because at least the Windows generate some incoming traffic on their own all the time.
