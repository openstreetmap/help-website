<p>The WIKI offers the following definitions for a streaming waterway. A stream is a naturally-forming waterway that is too thin to be classed as a river. It may not even be permanently filled with water. Waterway=river is used to tag a river. For larger rivers also have a look at waterway=riverbank. For really small rivers and streams, see waterway=stream. But when is a stream becoming a river, when you’re able to use a boat, or the width. What’s a good assumption for a point to tag stream or river ?</p>

<p>This is one case where the threshold to choose between one and the other is subjective. Like roads, different areas of the world will use a different threshold (arid regions will probably say "river" for smaller features). Most waterways will vary in width depending on season, with complicates things.</p>
<p>In any case, I'd say the criteria is the width of the waterway, and not its navigability or other attribute. The wiki mentions a width of 2 meters as an example stream width. I remember even looser definitions like "can be jumped over by a fit adult" :p My opinion (mapping a wet country) is that 2-3m is still a stream, and anything bigger is a river.</p>
<p>However, if tagging the width isn't too tedious, then do. Tagging the width makes the stream/river distinction moot, because it is a much more precise information. And in theory, renderers could use that to draw the waterways at scale in high-enough zooms (this is not yet the case of the default osm rendering).</p>
