<p>Cambridgeshire UK is the site of a major road and re-routing upgrade to the A14 east to west road. Several mappers including me have mapped the route and we have added some of the various construction, plant and accommodation sites and a new section that are being used already. There are several Borrow Pits by the route (6) where suitable soils such as gravels and clays for earthworks are taken. These pits will either be filled with less suitable soil, landscaped and or returned to farmland or will become wetland wildlife areas and possibly recreational land. Taginfo does not seem to have burrow pit yet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrow_pit">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrow_pit</a> should i have used the term, or used quarry which is not quite the same.

<p>In areas I am familiar with the road construction borrow pits look like small quarries, similar to those for sand or gravel. It looks like the quarry and quarry_type tags are not documented and not heavily used.</p>
<p>I'd probably tag the pits as quarry=borrow_pit.</p>
<p>I don't know what the current practice is in my area and it might vary depending if the work is done by the county, state or federal government, but I've seen places were borrow pits were simply left behind after construction completed. It is good that in your area they are remediated after they are no longer needed.</p>
