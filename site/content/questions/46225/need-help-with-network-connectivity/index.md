I found that one computer had malware and was sending a lot of network traffic and took it off the network and cleaned it. I still haven't added it back but still have some page not found issues, so I am thinking there might be another computer causing the issue. A lot of my request time outs directly from my DG show from trend micro. So I'll look into that. Thanks again for the help.</p></div><div id="comment-46346-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(02 Oct '15, 10:10)</span> VodoBaas1</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-46247" class="comment-tools"><span class="comments-showing"> showing 5 of 24 </span> <a href="#" class="show-all-comments-link">show 19 more comments</a></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-46247-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
