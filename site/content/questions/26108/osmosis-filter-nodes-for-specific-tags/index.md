<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I would like to parse *osm.pbf-files using osmosis as library inside my java application. I found <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@openstreetmap.org/msg19138.html">this</a> post which gives an idea how to do this. I successfully extracted the nodes/ways/relations inside a boundingbox and was also able to parse the nodes for some desired tags inside my application.</p>
<p>Since there are so many different tags in different situations, I would like to know, if osmosis can do some filtering for me? For example, currently it is enough for me, to extract all buildings inside the boundingbox. Is there a way to tell osmosis to do this for me, so I do not have to parse all nodes inside the boundingbox? Maybe there is a more general approach to this, e.g. to give osmosis a list of tags, for which it should parse?</p>
