<p>Many shops and other amenities (of a wide variety of types) may sell alcoholic drinks as part of their product mix, without it being their main product line. Examples might include Department Stores, Cafes, Convenience Stores, Supermarkets, Newsagents, Fast Food outlets, Bingo Halls, Bowling Alleys, etc. Similarly many, but not all, restaurants sell such drinks. In all these cases the tag <code>shop=alcohol</code> is not appropriate.</p>
<p>In the UK all such places need a license which is issued by the local authority: similar licensing regimes apply in other countries. This question is prompted by an open data file from the local council which includes a comprehensive list of such places.</p>
<p>The tag <code>[alcohol=*][1]</code> which is probably the most appropriate for this tagging issue has only been used 136 times. Is this the best way to address tagging this issue?</p>
<p>For cases where the restaurant does not have a license, but one is allowed to consume alcohol purchased beforehand, how should this be tagged?</p>
