<p>With regard to Facebook - no we (in OSM) can't do anything about it. If you have a problem with Facebook, or one of their other products such as Instagram or WhatsApp, you'll need to talk to Facebook about it. I'm from OSM's Data Working Group, and we get lots of questions and complaints about Facebook showing data that it shouldn't or not showing data that it should. We can't help with any of that.</p>
<p>All that said, if the thing that you are trying to add to OpenStreetMap is something that's verifiable (a bricks-and-mortar shop, office, or similar), then we will be able to help with that, but you will need to provide more details about what you are actually trying to do. Go to OpenStreetMap.org, zoom in on the place of interest, paste the URL as a comment to your question, and explain in more detail what you are <em>actually</em> trying to do.</p>
