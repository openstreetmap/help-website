<p>The Etrex32x has 8GB onboard and can take micro SD cards. I have used opentopomap a few times <a href="https://opentopomap.org/#map=3/42.75/69.61">https://opentopomap.org/#map=3/42.75/69.61</a> they do Garmin map downloads that will fit on a micro SD.</p>

<p>Thanks, Andy. I don't know how to get a micro SD card into the etrex 32x, but I could probably learn that. I'd also have to figure out how to get a map onto an SD card.</p>
<p>I've also never loaded maps other than what I get from OSM. Do you know whether these maps are suitable for geocaching? I'm used to getting a resolution of a few meters, and often need it.</p>

<p>Thanks to andy mackey for the link to opentopomap.org. I've downloaded the countries I need, which fit on the existing card after I removed two large files that served no purpose for me. I'll get used to the different map style.</p>
<p>I did try adding a second SD card, but it was a 32GB one that my son-in-law happened to have available. The Garmin wouldn't mount as a volume (or two volumes) on my computer with the large card in place, so that led nowhere. I assume the 32x won't work with an added SD card larger than 8GB, so if I need something larger I'll get an 8GB one. I've returned the 32GB one.</p>
<p>Thanks also to SomeoneElse for the link to the thread about the disappearance of Lambertus. I don't have the time and patience to read all 126 pages, but I get the idea. Looks like nobody knows who Lambertus is/was, so we can't be sure, but the timing of the abandonment of openstreetmap.nl strongly suggests that this site may have succumbed to the coronavirus.</p>

<p>I think the site was already lacking regular maintenance long before Covid. AFAIK, events in real life got in the way of keeping the site going. Like many OSM-related sites it's run by a volunteer as a hobby.</p>

<p>The site does a good description of putting a map on a Garmin even though it's cycle related. <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2019/08/how-to-install-free-maps-on-your-garmin-edge.html">https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2019/08/how-to-install-free-maps-on-your-garmin-edge.html</a></p>

<p>But it relies on OSM. Also, it's curious that the eTrex series, of which I have the latest (I think) model, is not mentioned as being supported, but it's also not mentioned as being unsupported. What he describes is basically what I used to do. And note that by 8 months after this article was published, it was already obsolete. Unless maybe the alternative server mentioned still has the OSM tiles available, even if they haven't been updated in over a year.</p>

<p>OSM map data is gathered by the contributors to openstreetmap. The independent web sites that offer free Garmin maps use the this free data to build maps of various styles. These websites need some income to pay for hosting. Some have ads, some ask for donations, updates take time so it isn't surprising some of these generous map builders do not have the time to keep them going.
