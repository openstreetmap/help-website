Please help as I recently determined she was using her primary FB acct to rekindle an old flame and my subsequent distrust is ripping our chance at staying married apart. I just need to know that she is being honest with me. However, every application out there requires a jailbroken iPhone and hers is not. If Wireshark isn't the one to use, can you recommend another that does the task discreetly.</p><p>We have a: Windows 7 laptop Macbook Air iPhone 4S iPad mini Utilizing a 2 TB Apple Time Capsule as the wifi router</p><p>Many thanks.</p><p>Rugger</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">wifi iphone</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>25 Aug '13, 12:20</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8d12961215b566416b049c277c6b8e64?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Rugger869&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Rugger869<br />

Facebook traffic is protected by SSL (at least the last time I tried), so you can't see login, password, or any activity. All you'll see is encrypted packets. You'd have to pull major stunts like man-in-the-middle attacks via (transparent) proxy to be able to see what is going on, and I cannot recommend to try this.
