Will somebody that has some pull around here actually add this to the list of feature requests? It would be extremely helpful to have all the basic fast forward, pause, stop, rewind functionality and it couldn't be all that difficult to add.</p></div><div id="comment-60234-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(21 Mar '17, 12:33)</span> royalpublishing</div></div><span id="60245"></span><div id="comment-60245" class="comment"><div id="post-60245-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>You can always save the FWD and REV audio and play them in a third party app such as Audacity.</p><p>But I also would love to see some enhancements in the Telephony and RTP analysis functions.</p></div><div id="comment-60245-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(21 Mar '17, 17:27)</span> Rooster_50</div></div><span id="60252"></span><div id="comment-60252" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-60252-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>@royalpublishing</p><p>Asking a question here, or providing an "answer" or a comment isn't the way to make an enhancement request.</p><p>The correct way to do that is via the <a href="https://bugs.wireshark.org">Wireshark Bugzilla</a>, checking if there is an existing item first, and if there isn't, raising a new one and marking it as an "enhancement request".</p><p>Even having done that you'll be reliant on someone volunteering their time to make the required changes.</p></div><div id="comment-60252-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(22 Mar '17, 03:26)</span> grahamb ♦</div></div><span id="60258"></span><div id="comment-60258" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-60258-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks for the info @grahamb, I will definitely check into that.</p></div><div id="comment-60258-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(22 Mar '17, 06:19)</span> royalpublishing</div></div><span id="60259"></span><div id="comment-60259" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-60259-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>@Rooster_50, I understand I can export the audio, then listen to it, but the point is, I need to see the network packets at certain spots in the audio stream... exporting just to listen in another program doesn't assist with this at all...
