So i play Xbox 360 and 1 guy that hates me got my IP Address and he has a booter system and eveytime he will be booting me out of xbox and will have trouble connecting back. So 1 day i was using the Wireshark program and was live capturing the packets and suddenly was booted from xbox and in the analyzer a red line appeared and after 5 minutes another red line appeared and after that i was back online, so im guessing he booted me off my connection for 5 minutes. So i check the IP address of the red line on the source column and it told me like a wierd website or a wanna be website so i manually resolve address and it gave me a ip address and looked it up and it said that it was a google ip address, so im guessing the person doing this to me is using a psecial booter that uses other ip addresses from other people. What i want is someone out there if they could help me out and trying to figure out the real ip address, telling me what to do and what not. One thing i know for sure, to resolve this i can change my ip address and that would solve the problem, but what i want first is to find out his real ip address and then change my ip address. So whoever can help, please post.
