<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I tried to find the answer to my question in the help pages, but I wasn't successful. :-(</p>
<p>I would like to place a link to openstreetmap on a commercial website. Therefore I would reference the OSM logo. If the user clicks on the logo, the openstreetmap webpage should be opened. Am I allowed to use the OSM logo without any fee? Are there any rules to obey? Or is it simply enough to place the link on my webpage?</p>

<p>Much guesses following - could be that others have a better help for you (<em>if not</em>, write an email to the address mentioned at the end of <span>Legal FAQ</span>).</p>
<p>I <em>guess</em> the info in <a href="/questions/18052/using-the-official-osm-logo/18053">that answer</a> is still true: the logo is trademarked but there are no published rules regarding trademark use. Also see <span>wiki: trademark</span>. What that means for you? I do not know. We should have better official guidelines. I would guess that every use is okay which does no harm to OSM and which does not misuse the logo is tolerated. I think that would apply to most links with an image as clickable element - however, I cannot tell you if that is okay for your website.</p>
<p>The copyright info regarding the logo is there: <span>File:Public-images-osm_logo.svg</span> (found via <span>wiki: Logos</span>). Somehow the licensing of the logo seems to be not respected by nearly every use (it would require that you attribute the logo author ...).</p>
<p>By the way: I think you should host the logo yourself. Oh, and thank you for supporting OSM!</p>
