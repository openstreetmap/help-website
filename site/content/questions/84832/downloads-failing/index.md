<p>I've been using OSM Boundaries to download Geojson files without issue for a few months now, up to and including last night. However, as of this morning around 10 AM PDT, all of my downloads are failing. No error is being given; the website just keeps indicating that it is thinking and never stops or succeeds.</p>
<p>I have tried changing the settings of the downloads, changing which data to download, changing the date of the OSM database, and wiping my cookies and reaccepting all cookies again. However, I still cannot download anything anymore.</p>
<p>Could some please help me, or suggest some other troubleshooting options?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Edit: Just to follow up, the website eventually times out and gives the following error:</p>
<p>"The page isn’t redirecting properly An error occurred during a connection to osm-boundaries.com. This problem can sometimes be caused by disabling or refusing to accept cookies."</p>
<p>Obviously, "Try[ing] Again" does not help. Has anyone else had a similar issue? I have accepted all cookies so I have no idea what the issue is..</p>
