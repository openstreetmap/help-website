I could find no method in Wireshark to export the data bytes from more than one packet, a online search was also unsuccessful. The UDP packets contained an audio stream in raw PCM format.</p><p>As a result I have created the pdml payload copy application using <a href="http://VB.Net">VB.Net</a> (V2.0) which stores all the hex data in the .pdml <a href="http://file.to">file.to</a> a new file. Using the program I was able to load the raw data file created into Audacity to playback the transmitted audio.</p><p>I have successfully used the application to analyse a .pdml file containing over 20,000 packets (over 300Mb in size). The application can store the byte data for a maximum of 100,000 packets.</p><p>Version 1.1 (12/09/12) Added option to select any field contained in .pdml file (enter required search string), which will output the requested data in text format.</p><p>Requires <a href="http://VB.Net">VB.Net</a> 2.0 runtime files.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">pdml export</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>13 Sep '12, 02:25</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aca92b1346da932886779daed561c95f?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="time2innov8&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>time2innov8<br />
