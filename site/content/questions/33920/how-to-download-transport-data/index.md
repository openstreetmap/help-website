<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would like to extract OSM data concerning public transports (all kinds: bus/trams/... lines and stops) on a city I'm interested in. So on www.openstreetmap.org I select the "transport map" layers, which are perfectly displayed. But when I click on "extract", among the several layers I obtain (that I've converted into shp with FME), I don't get those public transport layers that were previously displayed (or the webpage stays blocked and I can't even download anything).</p>
<p>So am I doing it the right way? How can I download those layers?</p>
<p>Thanks for you help!</p>

<p>The "transport map" is one rendering of the data (of which there are many others). When you click "export" at the top of the page you're taken to a screen such as <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=5/56.133/-15.073">this one</a>. Note that it offers numerous sources of data via external APIs (e.g. Overpass) and extracts (e.g. Geofabrik).</p>
<p>If your area is small enough, and you click the "export" button, you'll get all the OSM data within your area. It's not split by layers in a traditional GIS sense. See <a href="http://wiki.osm.org/wiki/Elements">this page</a> for what data you'll actually be getting. If you only want certain kinds of information, you'll need to find out how that data is stored in OSM (for example, <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bus">bus</a> routes are stored as relations) and extract the data that you want.</p>
<p>When you export data from OSM, or download an extract from e.g. Geofabrik, you're getting all the data - you'll need to process it to create the "layers" that you want. Of course, <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Shapefiles">some people might have done some of this already</a> and you may be able to use their work.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your answer. Downloading/extracting data from e.g. OSM, Bbbike or Geofabrik an passing it into shapefiles is indeed not an issue. My problems came when I started to look for this specific data concerning public transport networks (that I need as shapefiles).</p>
<p>If I understand well, even if I see the data I would like to get on pages like OSM ("transport map"), demo.3liz.com/osmtransport or openmap.lt, it does not mean that the data exists as layers. Those are only renderings of the original osm data. Is that right?</p>

<p>As far as I can see, the OSM "transport map" is just one rendered map - no overlays. The other two are rendered maps (Mapquest's tiles in the first case and OSM in the second) with transport route overlays on them (as a transparent tile layer in the second case). I can't see an "about" screen on either of the latter two maps, but I'd guess that all the overlaid data is extracted from OSM separately prior to displaying on top.</p>
<p>So yes, it sounds like you'd need to define the data that you want and extract it, or find someone who's already done that.</p>
