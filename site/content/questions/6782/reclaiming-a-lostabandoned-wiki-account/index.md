<p>Someone (quite possibly me) has registered a wiki account using "my" OSM username. As noted on my OSM profile page, I only quite recently rediscovered that I even had an account.</p>
<p>The account in question had [links removed] no user page or talk page, never made any edits, and according to the log was never even created (which raised its own side-question about how an account could exist without having been created)... in short there seems little evidence that the account actually exists other than that I am blocked from registering an account in that username.</p>
<p>It also doesn't seem to have an email address associated with it if I ask it to send out a password reset.</p>
<p>Is it possible to reclaim that account, or do I have to register a new ID everywhere across the OSM project in order to have a consistent ID across the site?</p>
