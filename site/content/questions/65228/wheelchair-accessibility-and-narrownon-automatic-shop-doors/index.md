<p>In Europe, many shops are wheelchair accessible in the sense that there are no steps to get inside, however they do not have automatic doors, and the doors themselves are not very wide, so that a person on a wheelchair might have some trouble pushing the door open (which will push back to keep it closed, to preserve heat) and entering at the same time.</p>
<p>In other words, if there is someone nearby to help open the door, it is accessible (or barely, due to door width), but it is not as simple as entering a shop with a wide automatic door.</p>
<p>Should such places be tagged wheelchair=yes? wheelchair=partial? wheelchair=assisted?</p>
