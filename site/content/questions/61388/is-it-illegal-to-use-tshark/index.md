A tool can be used legally, and it can be used illegally. There is nothing intrinsically illegal about the tool itself.</p><p>Specific laws in specific countries will vary, but I can think of cases where it could be used illegally in the US. For example, if you were to break into the wire closet of a building, set up some taps and used Wireshark to intercept an enterprise's VoIP calls, I have to think that would be illegal. Meanwhile if you use Wireshark as a network administrator to troubleshoot your network, that would almost certainly not be.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>14 May '17, 19:04</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f533c5f20f9c9afbf4b03de08a100e11?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Quadratic&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Quadratic<br />
