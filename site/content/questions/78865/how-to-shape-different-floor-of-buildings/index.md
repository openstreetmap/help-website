<p>Where a building has different heights in different areas the most common solution is a tagging scheme called <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Simple_3D_Buildings">Simple 3D Buildings</a>. This involves creating:</p>
<ol>
<li>A closed way or multipolygon for the whole building with the relevant <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building"><code>building=*</code> tag</a>.</li>
<li>Additional ways or multipolygons with <code>building:part=*</code> for the different sections of that building.</li>
</ol>
<p>The area with the <code>building=*</code> tag should have all the tags that apply to the whole building. The areas with <code>building:part=*</code> should have all the tags that only apply to that section. See the link above for a proper explanation.</p>
<p>Multiple buildings or houses that share common walls: mappers usually draw these as separate buildings sharing nodes along the common wall, but I am not sure what you mean by "common floor level also" so I may have misinterpreted your description. <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3Dterrace">Terraced houses</a> usually have floors at the same heights, but are often mapped as separate buildings when mapped at the highest level of detail.</p>

<p>If the two building share a all of the same nodes along the border then they will be considered touching but not overlapping.</p>
<p>Truly overlapping building are generally discouraged unless one building really does overhang the other.</p>
<p>The quickest way I know to create terraces from an outline way is JOSM's <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/Terracer">Terracer plugin</a>, but it doesn't do well with complex outlines. The <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/BuildingsTools">Buildings Tools</a> plugin is also good for creating the initial outlines.</p>
