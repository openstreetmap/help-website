<p>The user was registered at 24/8/2014 and he made only 3 changes at this day. These changes was made only at the site I've mentioned. There was deleted randomly about 40% of the roads and the buildings at the site. I don't think I will get the answer on my PM from this editor. I live near this area and I know there is nothing changed. Noone has destroyed the roads and buildings there. So it was 100% mistake or vandal action.</p>

<p>OSM is a co-operative project, now that you know who did the edits you could, and should contact him and ask him. Be diplomatic as there may be good reasons for his edits. Happy Mapping. However if you do not get a favorable response I'm sure someone will explain or do a reversion.</p>

<p>Before writing such standard reply, Andy, you should have a quick look at the area and concerned changesets. Here it is a new contributor with 3 changesets only deleting ways. This is pure vandalism. @Vitali : search "vandalism" in the wiki to report this user behaviour. Risk is that he will continue this later and he should be blocked by the DGW. Then search "revert" or "undo" here or in the wiki and you will find how to revert a changeset from JOSM.</p>
