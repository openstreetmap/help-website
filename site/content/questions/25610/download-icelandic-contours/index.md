<p>Apparently some other sources cover iceland, and are used for the DEMs at <a href="http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html#nat">http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html#nat</a> . Please check their terms and conditions before use.</p>
<p>I found this link by using "iceland dem" as my google search query.</p>
<p>I don't know if OpenCycleMap uses this DEM or some other. On their doc page at <a href="http://www.opencyclemap.org/docs/">http://www.opencyclemap.org/docs/</a> they (that is, Andy Allan) states they use SRTM, but that may be inaccurate, as there seems to be no SRTM coverage of iceland...</p>

<p>thank you for the response. I had actually come across viewfinderpanoramas before (sorry I forgot to mention). I will try their source again, but there is a strange possibility that the specific area I am looking for is also not contained withing that data.</p>
<p>I shall check and post back what I find.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the help</p>

<p>ok. I was wrong. the viewfinderpanoramas dem file does contain the data i needed. It appeared it did not when directly importing into JOSM. However, I used srtm2osm to create 10m elevation contours, and it worked beautifully.</p>
<p>I can now import into JOSM, but I don't know how to convert this data into an SVG now... I tried importing into maperitive as it has a good svg export function, but the osm data does not appear to render. any ideas?</p>

<p>Ok, problem seemingly solved. I had to change maperitive rendering style to wireframe. It then successfully exported the contours as svg.</p>
<p>I have since imported them into gimp as paths and all appears well. Great stuff.</p>

<p>scratch the last; I remain unsatisfied. Perhaps Andy at opencyclemap does have different sources... I have uploaded my custom osm here: <a href="http://filebin.ca/sI52mr8j6ph">http://filebin.ca/sI52mr8j6ph</a></p>
<p>If anyone can, please import into maperitive and compare to the opencyclemap overlay. There is some x y displacement, but that would be curable. However it seems there is a difference in rotation, or simply distortion.</p>
<p>I wanted to use these contours in conjunction with a map such as openstreetmap...this distortion ruins things.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
