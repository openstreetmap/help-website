<p>Having trouble figuring out the best way to map a difficult intersection. I have seen it done in differently, in the map. The highway and junction wiki pages offer no suggestions.</p>
<p>Imagine a road coming to a T-intersection, but each turning direction bears off, so it forms a Y-intersection (with the intersecting road still at the top of the Y), such that there is a impassible triangle between the three roads. Each road has traffic in both directions.</p>
<p>One way that I have seen this done is calling each branch the name of the original street.</p>
<p>Another way that I have seen it is designating one branch a highway=service and leaving it unnamed.</p>
<p>Yet another way is tagging one branch as a "highway link" and leaving it unnamed.</p>
<p>Generally, there are no housenumbers on either branch of the intersection, so it would not really matter for numbering, but my sense is a road name should be used for one road, whenever possible. I would like to know how best to handle this for routing.</p>

<p>2 and 5 are the correct way to do it - i.e. a way with the same name and highway type. There is no rule in OSM that "a road name should be used in one road wherever possible".</p>
<p>_link tags are used for roads with slip-road characteristics, and could potentially be used in such circumstances but in practice are used for more complex intersections.</p>
<p>A service road has its own access implications so would be incorrect in these circumstances.</p>
