<p>So, I created my openstreetmap account years ago. I tried to reset password, but it said I didn't have an account for my current email address. I created a new account, then found the email for my original account. I deleted my new account (which has been used to do nothing, and was deleted within minutes of its creation), but now when I try to change my email, It says both my old and current email are already taken - How do I totally junk the account I deleted so I can update to my current email address on my old account?</p>
