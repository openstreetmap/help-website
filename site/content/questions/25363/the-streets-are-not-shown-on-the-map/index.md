<p>Hello! I save a selected area of ​​the map through the Export Data (map is required to work in a special program for the design) - but in the program of the streets are not displayed! Perhaps this is the problem not the maps, and the program itself, but check it out somewhere else (on the navigator, for example) is currently not possible! As for the streets are not shown, which I mentioned earlier: compare the characteristics of those streets that are displayed and those that do not - all the characteristics that at first glance, the same, but some streets on the stored map is displayed and some not? I through Export Data directly from the site, download the files with the extension .osm, and then open it in the program! Subsequently, the program can save the map with the extension .vsd, ie processes it through Visio! For example: <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit">http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit</a> # map = 1 ... 6/40.07554! The horizontal street in the middle (Veterans) stored on the map is displayed, and the upper and lower horizontal streets (Nekrasov and Kurgan) - no!</p>
