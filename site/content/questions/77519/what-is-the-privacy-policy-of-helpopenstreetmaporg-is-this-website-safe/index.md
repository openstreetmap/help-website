<p>Please explain more precisely what kind of safety you are looking for. If your fear is that this whole web site is a scam then it is probably not much help if someone ON that web site tells you to trust it ;)</p>

<p>Hi, thank you for your fast reply. I dont think its a scam, osm wouldn't list it in help section if it was one. Its just the osqa system it runs on appears to be outdated, so it might have security holes. Do I have to worry my email and ip address will get leaked, because of it?</p>

<p>Your email and IP address could certainly get leaked by OSQA or any other of the myriad pieces of software you might be logging in to with your account. I don't think that the fact that OSQA is not actively developed any more makes a huge difference here. If you are worried that somebody finds out that a certain question was asked from a certain IP, then use a VPN - no matter whether the system you post the question on is OSQA or anything else!</p>

<p>It should be noted that OSQA uses gravatars due to that the site does leak IP address and a hash of your e-mail to Automattic, see <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy#Third_party_provided_services_and_data">https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy#Third_party_provided_services_and_data</a></p>
