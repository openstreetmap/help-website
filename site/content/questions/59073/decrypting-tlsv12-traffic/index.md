Since I have access to the server, I was able to copy it's private key. I would like to ask what should I do know to be able to decrypt this traffic. I did add the key to the properties page for the SSL protocol under the key section. The election that I provided was the server IP address, port 443 and protocol http with the link to the location of the .key file. After doing this I saved it and returned to the data and proceeded to follow the stream but to no avail since the data did not decrypt. Is there something that I am missing. Should I be using a file with a different extension??</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thank you Jesus</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">ssl tlsv1.2 decrypt</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>25 Jan '17, 20:43</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f76e660895fd30cdecf30c8c53f1adae?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="jdpadro&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>jdpadro<br />
