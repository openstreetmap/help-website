<p>when Chennai is searched, only the centre place marker is shown. I want to add the corporation boundary which exists as Chennai (1766358). I have tried to change its name to be identified separately but I am new and unable to figure this out. It's important because I am able to download the network as a graph in Python but chennai is marked as a node, not a boundary which makes it not possible to be downloaded as a graph</p>

<p>Could you please be a bit more specific where you try to search for Chennai and where and in what way you download data? What do you want to download exactly? As you stated, the boundary does exist.</p>
