First I would thank Riverbed to sustain the wordeful job done here , so my question is a genuine need for understanding . I got the trial and was thinking to get the subscription exposed here on the web, , but at a first look, I was really not able to understand the added value it should add to wireshark. I see some good dashboard , but cannot find something 'you cannot miss' or is not better detailed in wireshark. If someone could explain the use case for such an integration , I would be grateful. My eyes say more scapy after wireshark than PA-PE , so I am probably missing something .

From what you both told, it seems something that could be better used to get a the big picture. But details are still got in wireshark. I will probably get a better idea when against some large traffic scenario. At the moment I still cannot see a free / 690$ balance , with their respective parts in the job. Obviously 29 / year is a coin , but I reported the license fee just to give another shot at the question starting this post.</p><p>The feeling was that when you have the top, imagine the paid will be the TOP.</p></div><div id="comment-50843-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(12 Mar '16, 09:28)</span> fabio_dalfonso</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-50841" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-50841-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
