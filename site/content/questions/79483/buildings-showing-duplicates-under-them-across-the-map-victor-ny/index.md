<p>When editing They are clearer to see how it's all messed up. I'm not sure if someone who knows the system a slight bit more than I can figure out who did it, why and what's going on here.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>There was a large import of building footprints recently done by user:NYbuildings. I read about the import in passing but don't often map in NYS, even though I'm from Buffalo and lived near Victor for about 10 years.</p>
<p>Usually, the person doing such an import checks to be sure nothing is overwritten or duplicated but evidently this checking was not done or is incomplete.</p>
<p>It might be best to contact this user via a changeset comment to inform him or her of what you found. If you get no response in a reasonable amount of time, you can delete the duplicate outlines. It is probably best, however, to let the importer take care of this.</p>
<p>I hope this helps,</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<p>Given that the "newest" version of the building is by a user whose <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/NYbuildings">page</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Main focus of this account are building footprints in New York, using NYS OpenData, compile it with QGis, put it in OSM and combine it manually with existing structures. -&gt; my main OSM account is miluethi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suspect that this is the result of a bad import that hasn't been declared on the changeset. This is not in line with import guidelines as I understand them so the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Data_working_group">DWG</a> might be interested in this if you dropped them an email, but it might be worth contacting the mapper first in case it was a solitary goof in an otherwise OK process.</p>

<p>I checked around the Victor area briefly and it looks as though the errors you found are just a couple of outlines the importer missed.</p>
<p>If you're aware of other errors, then contacting the importer would be the best way forward. But if these few buildings are the only duplicates, I would simply delete them leaving the original outlines intact.</p>
