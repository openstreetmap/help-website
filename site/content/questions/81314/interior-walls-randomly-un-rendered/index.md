<p>First question :)</p>
<p>I recently mapped the interior stores of Golden Square Shopping Centre in Warrington's town centre. All was well and good, even when I had finished. It's been a day since, and since then, suddenly when I zoom in, the interior walls have completely disappeared. I can't think of something I may have changed that made that happen.</p>
<p>The Grand Arcade in Wigan doesn't have this problem, but only its corridors are mapped as the main building, rather than the whole enclosing footprint of the building. So I figured that may be the issue, and that something had newly changed in how things are rendered. Except that the streets in Warrington town centre that I've also mapped in the exact same fashion, with enclosing buildings mapped before inner shops, don't have this issue.</p>
<p>I think this change is ugly enough to be a problem, as I find it harder to visually navigate. And I'm expecting the way I mapped it to be scrutinized, but until this point it was functionally and visually good in my opinion. Now it just looks like precisely placed points for each store instead of areas.</p>
<p>Any help as to something I've done wrong, if it fixes the issue, thanks for in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Falsernet.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that what you are experiencing is just a temporary glitch or caching issue.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I'm wondering about a few things.</p>
<p>You have mapped the complet building in a <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/12932285">relation</a> of an outer line and that small oval cut-out. That's fine. But then you have tagged each individual shop also as a building. So basically you are saying there are a lot of small wall-to-wall buildings inside a huge building. This is not what we usually do (at least as far as I know, mapping practices might differ in your area).</p>
<p>If you explicitly want to map walls and the like take a look at the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Simple_Indoor_Tagging">Simple Indoor Tagging</a> scheme.</p>
<p>To describe vertical relationships you need to apply the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:layer"><code>layer</code></a> key. So for example the rooftop car park needs to get a higher layer than the shops. You have applied the <a href="http://Key:level"><code>level</code></a> key but that is not sufficient. The <code>layer</code> key governs how things are rendered and how routers connect features. It just shows the sequence of how objects are stacked. The <code>level</code> key is basically there to provide orientation and labeling in terms of actual building floors.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of small errors like implausible opening hours, overlapping objects, etc. Mapping such complex structure I would highly recommending you switching to the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM">JOSM</a> editor. It offers much more possibilities and a better validation than the iD editor.</p>

<p>Good to know, regarding it being temporary.</p>
<p>The oval cut-out is part of the corkscrew car park entrance. (It would be a pig to map as a service road - instead I opted to put the car park entrance point as where you enter the corkscrew from the road; navigation inwards is very simple in real life as long as you drive slowly enough not to crash inside.)</p>
<p>I'll be sure to investigate simple indoor mapping! The issue though, with putting the car park above the shops in layer, is that it will cover them up and make many of the stores being mapped useless to begin with; I'm not aware of a UI that uses OSM data that lets you select a floor, but I assume it'd use the level tags to select specific floors.</p>
<p>As for opening hours, I thought I'd been quite diligent with the specific shops when I added opening hours, based on data from businesses' own websites. If you remember a specific example of the hours being 'implausible', I'd like to hear so I can fix it, unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean by implausible. Perhaps I messed up the mental conversion from 12hr to 24hr clock.</p>

<p>It's of course unfortunate when a car park covers up other features. But that's the case with many things (buildings on top of an underground station, shops on top of other shops in a multi-storey shopping center, a bridge on top of riverside restaurants etc.). You shouldn't count too much into what the standard map on openstreetmap.org shows. <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tagging_for_the_renderer"><em>Don't map for the renderer</em></a> is one of OSM good practices. Instead you should map the reality and different data consumers (maps, routers, apps, ...) can decide how to interpret them and what do display and what not.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://openlevelup.net/?l=3#17/53.38978/-2.59441">OpenLevelUp</a> to see the levels you have mapped (seems strange there are a few L3 objects but no L2 ones).</p>
<p>The opening hours of <em>Game</em> are not well tagged. Feed the string into the <a href="https://openingh.openstreetmap.de/evaluation_tool/?EXP=Mo-We%2009%3A30-17%3A30%3B%20Th%2009%3A30-20%3A00%3B%20Fr%2009%3A30-17%3A30%3B%20Sa%2009%3A00-1%3A00%3B%20Su%2011%3A00-17%3A00&amp;lat=48.7769&amp;lon=9.1844&amp;mode=0&amp;DATE=1629142560000">Opening Hours Evaluation Tool</a> to see why you should use <code>,</code> instead of ;`.</p>
<p>To find more problems like the opening hours one use some <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Quality_assurance">quality assurance tool</a> like <em>Keep Right</em> or the built in JOSM validator.</p>
