<p>Hi,</p>
<p>is there a known issue with uploading GPX files currently? I tried to upload a GPX file about 10 times till now. Normally I get a bar on top of my personal GPS trace list saying, that it might take up to 30 minutes to save the trace in the database, and that I will get an email, when this is done. In the past this worked for many years, but today firefox shows a swinging working symbol on the tab and displays something like "Sending request to openstreetmap.org" at the bottom of the page for a long while and then these both disapear, and only the upload page in its last stage (upload button is grayed out) is displayed. If I refresh the page, my file name and my description are displayed as before, but now I can click again on the upload button. If doing so, the same game repeats.</p>
<p>I read here in an older similar issue, that it could be a problem of firefox. Does anyone know more about this?</p>
<p>Best Regards tkansgar</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>I just tried it with IE. It's almost the same. Only the waiting time is much longer, and IE then says, that there is no access to the site.</p>

<p>... but now I've got an email, and my trace is listed on my private page, although no browser displayed the corresponding message. Strange! Don't know, which browser was successful.</p>
