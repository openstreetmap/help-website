I was lazy in not providing the whole error message. I was lazy in not providing you with i searched numerous forums before landing here. I was lazy in not providing you with yes i read the wiki but did not point out a where is the boot with a usb live stick in the article.<br />
I was lazy in not providing you with the true to false statement parameter. I am not being negative or a smart a$$, i probably do not have you experience or skill as i am trying to build them. Thank you for your time and patience i will continue to work on this problem until it is solved.</p></div><div id="comment-53364-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(12 Jun '16, 03:20)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">rupertrlg</span></div></div><span id="53371"></span><div id="comment-53371" class="comment"><div id="post-53371-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>OK, so I understand that you do bump into the security mechanism as I have suspected, and that the distinctive point from all the other questions on the same topic is that you are running Kali from an USB stick.</p><p>As you wrote that you could change something from false to true, I assume that it is possible to modify the contents of the USB stick, i.e. that any configuration changes you eventually make will survive switching off the machine and booting from the stick again. Can you confirm this?</p><p>Does running Kali from USB stick imply that you must start Wireshark as superuser?</p><p>Or, vice versa, does running Wireshark as non-superuser remove the issue with the Lua error as described above but instead cause an issue with capturing?</p></div><div id="comment-53371-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(12 Jun '16, 06:29)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">sindy</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-53358" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-53358-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
