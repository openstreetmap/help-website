I believe this is correct TCP behaviour, not? Then the sequence number of the next servers frame equals the acknowledgement number of the clients ACK frame. Also normal TCP behaviour? This is correctly seen on the clients wireshark log. But the servers log shows the ACK frames later. If the server would receive that package really later in time, how does the server know the acknowledgement number of the clients ACK frame in advance? This makes me suspect that wireshark log is not in real time with the TCP stack receiving the frames.

The server does not know in advance what the next ACK number is, it knows which segments it has already sent and will continue with the next blocks. The ACKs from the client just tell the server up till which point the client has received the data.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>04 Feb '11, 06:12</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7901a94d8fdd1f9f47cda9a32fcfa177?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="SYN-bit&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>SYN-bit ♦♦</span><br />

It will ACK if it had real data to send back, but otherwise it waits until the delayed ACK timer expires. As long as the sender doesn't assume the packet is lost and it has to retransmit then we are good. (Not sure what this timer is but it seems to be by default 200ms in Windows, and as low as 40ms in Linux). Of course the sender cannot send more unACKnowledged segments than the negotiated TCP window allows.</p></div><div id="comment-2170-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(05 Feb '11, 16:21)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">martyvis</span></div></div><span id="2227"></span><div id="comment-2227" class="comment"><div id="post-2227-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks for all the information.
