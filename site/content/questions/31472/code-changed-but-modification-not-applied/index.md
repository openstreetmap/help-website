I use only tshark and dissectors (packet-camel). Before today, I can build successfully on my server and running well. Then I copy all source code to other server. I also can build without any errors and run well. Today, I need to debug and comment out all the print in the packet-camel.c but didn't see any effect after building. I change the tshark.c and see the modification. I re-change packet-camel.c again with more modification, remove all my print function but they are NOT applied after building. I didn't do any loading or install new plugin. I just copy the source from one server to the other.

The root cause is:after installing (make install). only if running the tshark (/Trunk-1.10/tshark), the changes are applied. it means, all other running tshark does not make any sense. So if I run "nohup /usr/src/cs/Trunk-1.10/tshark -i 2 -P -w /tmp/Log.pcap -b filesize:655350&amp;" ==&gt; It works. But if run "nohup tshark -i 2 -P -w /tmp/Log.pcap -b filesize:655350&amp;" ==&gt; Nothing applied even I could see the change in tshark.c but other libs are not.

I also try "make uninstall" , then remove all source, untar the source code again and compile but problem still there. With this source code, I also run on other server but nothing wrong. One clue: On the running server, previously, we installed this source code (version-1). After that, we change the code (version-2) and now, according to the log, when we run "nohup /usr/src/cs/Trunk-1.10/tshark -i 2 -P -w /tmp/Log.pcap -b filesize:655350&amp;" =&gt; it is version-2. But if we run "nohup tshark -i 2 -P -w /tmp/Log.pcap -b filesize:655350&amp;" =&gt; It is version-1. Is there any problem with system issue while using different accounts? In my opinion, it is not software issue, it should be the problem of OS.</p></div><div id="comment-31538-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(05 Apr '14, 02:17)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">hoangsonk49</span></div></div><span id="31553"></span><div id="comment-31553" class="comment"><div id="post-31553-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><blockquote><p>I have already killed tshark process (ps -ef|rgep tshark AND kill -9)</p></blockquote><p>did you double check that all tshark processes have been killed before you ran <code>make install</code>?</p><p>Please run the following commands and post the output and the generated file somewhere.</p><blockquote><p>ls -al /usr/local/bin/tshark<br />
