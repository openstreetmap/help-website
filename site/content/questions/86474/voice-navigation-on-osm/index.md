<p>I had no idea until now that the Garmin Montana supported sound, but I do know that other Garmin devices that do (old Garmin Nuvi devices) certainly can speak names from routable maps that I created using OSM data.</p>
<p>Do the maps you have tried support routing at all - perhaps they do, and just give then normal Garmin bleep when you need to make a turn?</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by "Should I switch to unadulterated OSM" though?</p>

<p>Have you had your Nuvi on a route that includes a trail or path?</p>
<p>Ever since OSM took their download server offline I've been downloading OSM maps from other sources. Those ones mentioned modify some objects and colors based on purpose of map.</p>
<p>I create a route in Basecamp -- picking only trails, send it to device as usual. Device profile is set to Automotive mode, lock on road and I was using Nuvi dashboard. Its been raining here in los angeles for a couple weeks and trail testing has been limited. But last weekend I tried it and no voice, with same settings as when I got voice in car</p>

<p>Only by accident! I actually removed all paths and tracks from the data before creating the map for it, because it's a car sat-nav.</p>
<p>However, I'm sure I've used it (just as a test really) with walking routes and heard some directions.</p>
<p>One thought though - spoken directions depend heavily on the name of the thing that your navigating along - did the maps/paths you're using have any sort of name? If not, that might be the problem. If you want to make your own, have a look <a href="https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/mkgmap_style_ajt/blob/master/README.md">here</a>. <a href="https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/mkgmap_style_ajt/blob/master/garmin_map_etrex_03.sh">This script</a> adds lots of information into the name field in brackets, so almost every path or track will get a name. You'll need to edit the script to download an area around you, of course, and you might want to extract a smaller area from that for testing.</p>

<p>thanks for the links. yes, the trails have names and they appear in text popups with directions as I hike along -- i can get beeps too.</p>
<p>...just had a thought....</p>
<p>maybe Automotive mode ignores non-streets. I'll go against Garmin's instructions and try it in Hiking mode during next test. I don't need it to look like car nav</p>
<p>I can extract a small area from OSM site and will try that. I've fiddled with mkgmap, splitter, jnx2img, mapc2mapc, etc in the past for other reasons. they give me a headache haha. this mapping stuff is complicated when getting down to the nitty gritty. I stopped at trying to edit TYP files ü§™</p>

<p>I was able to do another test and got the Montana to voice-navigate on trails using the trail name.</p>
<p>On this test I created a waypoint about a mile up and a couple of turns beyond trailhead. At home I set the Go-to to that point and started driving to trailhead. I was able to transition from street to trail.</p>
<p>I used OpenMapChest map. It appears that using osm2img on an osm extract removes routability?</p>
<p>It turns out the instructions in Garmin manual are just suggestions. I was able to use Montana in hiking mode, no lock on road.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Maps for Garmin maps can be created as "routable" or "non-routable". I've no idea what "osm2img" does, but "mkgmap" is pretty much the gold standard here, and that works just fine if you ask it to create a routable map (parameter "--route"). Even if you're not using the script itself, the parameters used in <a href="https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/mkgmap_style_ajt/blob/master/garmin_map_etrex.sh">here</a> should be useful</p>
