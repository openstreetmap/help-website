<p>My scenario is: merging OSM administrative feature data with the various industry datasets, basically, I need global, but only the first admin level of one country, usually level 4, some could be level 5 or 6. Some changes would be made on attribute data, such as lining up the state name to the ISO name but won't change the shapes as OSM has the best shape already.</p>
<p>This dataset will be used internally for map display, spatial analysis, etc. Eventually will be applied to a client-facing product as the background reference data, or maybe attach with some industry value to the state polygon. The state data won't be a stand-alone product but only as part of reference data in the product.</p>
<p>I want to know the license issue in this scenario.</p>
<p>I read through the Collective Database and Derivative database. Seems it triggered the Derivative database and could cause legal issues? but I'd like to know what is the best way if I really need to extract this dataset?</p>
