<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've been getting fairly familiar with openstreetmap and specifically with generating mbtiles databases/archives over the past few months.</p>
<p>Now, I'm currently in the process of generating MBTiles files based on GeoJSON extracts generated from .osm.pbf files, this is going good as well.</p>
<p>I am, however, getting stuck at the styling part. I'm trying to display the maps in a webpage with Mapbox GL JS, which is working to the extend that I can zoom in/out and drag the map without getting any console errors, only the tiles remain entirely blank (or, grey?).</p>
<p>When using OpenMapTiles' tileserver-gl, the maps do display in the form of lines only (as shown in the example (<a href="https://openmaptiles.org/docs/generate/custom-vector-from-shapefile-geojson/))">https://openmaptiles.org/docs/generate/custom-vector-from-shapefile-geojson/))</a> but when using any slippy map solution (I've tried MapBox GL JS, Leaflet and OpenLayers), I don't see anything.</p>
<p>I've hosted an openmaptiles server before (data generated from pbf files through the methods described by openmaptiles with docker) which renders perfectly fine, so I'm probably doing something wrong here but I don't see what.</p>
<p>Any ideas/suggestions would be welcome! I can probably upload data to a server if someone would like to have a look at it.</p>
