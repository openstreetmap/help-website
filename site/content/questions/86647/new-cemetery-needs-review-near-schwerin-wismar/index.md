<p>I think it's more common to tag burial areas as graveyards if they are right next to churches, but this may vary by region. You might have better luck contacting someone with local knowledge on the relevant regional subform in <a href="https://community.openstreetmap.org/">https://community.openstreetmap.org/</a> .</p>
<p>Approximate boundaries normally aren't a problem as long as they are reasonably correct. As another remote mapper the only issue I can think of would be if the map you mention might not be out of copyright yet.</p>

<p>The map was prepared before WW2 by Germany.  "Confiscated by the Allies" and reprinted by Britain with legend and other info around the outside in English, French, and German. Found the map researching my genealogy, but the boundaries are solely based on aerial image in the iPad app I use for editing. The map makes it look like the graveyard completely surrounds the church, but the aerial shows only one "might be" grave in the otherwise smooth south lawn.</p>
