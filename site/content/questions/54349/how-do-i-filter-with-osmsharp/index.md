<p>The homepage for OsmSharp brags about having documentation, but it is minimal and horribly out of date! I was using version 4.2.0.723, but recently updated to 5.0.6. I thought that maybe I was the one who was out of date, but even after the update the documentation is incorrect and does not help. The only change was that all the namespaces were changed and some classes were removed or added. I still don't have a single clue how to filter the data!</p>
<p>I would like to filter using a bounding box. Any help would be much appreciated!</p>
