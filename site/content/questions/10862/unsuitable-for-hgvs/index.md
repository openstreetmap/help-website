<p>I have done a GPS survey on a few miles of previously unmapped roads. In many parts they are very narrow with some tight turns. No formal passing places - had to reverse into farm gates, etc. Whilst suitable for light goods vehicles (Ford Transit type) and cars, I worry that a heavy goods vehicle would dumbly follow his sat-nav and get stuck!</p>
<p>There are no formal signs to show 'No HGV', just common sense. Will HGV=no be picked up by sat-nav, or is another tag preferred?</p>

<p>There is a tag <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Access">hgv=no</a> which satnav applications might or might not consider (depending on the application), although that is intended for legal access rights, rather than whether it is physically possible.</p>
<p>A better way would be to tag any <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_the_United_Kingdom#Size.2FWeight_restrictions">maxweight/maxwidth/maxlength/etc</a> type signed restrictions, and also add <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:width">width</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:lanes">lanes</a> tags to the road. This would require the satnav application to know more information about the vehicle using it, but could lead to better overall results.</p>

<p>+1 for "max*=" and "width=", which are used by satnavs if you key in the vehicle's characteristics. "hgv=no" is for legal restrictions, and should not be used for technical ones. "lanes=" and "surface=" could probably also be used by satnavs, but I don't know of any satnav that does.</p>

<p>Answer appreciated. However there are no restriction signs at any of the exits onto larger roads. There are several signs on nearby roads with a crossed out lorry + sat-nav motif. So locals are aware of problems and I don't want to add to them.</p>
<p>If I mark road with width=Xmts that will only be true in the narrowest parts. Also does lanes=1 indicate only ONE lane, not one lane per direction? These lanes have grass down the middle as only a motorbike could put a wheel into the middle of the road.</p>

<p>Not sure what a "crossed out lorry + sat-nav" signpost means, but a "crossed out lorry" signpost can be tagged "hgv=no" in osm.</p>
<p>"Width=" is for the narrowest part indeed, but consider splitting the way if the road suddenly narrows or something.</p>
<p>"lanes=" indicates total number of lanes, both directions (see wiki).</p>

<p>Will use highway=unclassified, lanes=1, source=gps_survey if that seem the best description. The roads serve scattered farms and cottages (highway=residential seems to overstate the local population).</p>
<p>"crossed out lorry + satnav" sign is produced by local council, but is not in highway code. Typical example on minor road off A482, grid ref: 52.073888,-4.024429, as seen on google street view.</p>
