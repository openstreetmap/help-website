It's kind of funny because they're adding ambiguity between implementations through their 'unambiguous' statement. They are clear about how unclear we can be:</p><pre><code>Specifically, an ACK SHOULD be generated for at least every second full-sized segment, and MUST be generated within 500 ms of the arrival of the first unacknowledged packet.

The requirement that an ACK &quot;SHOULD&quot; be generated for at least every second full-sized segment is listed in [Bra89] in one place as a SHOULD and another as a MUST.  Here we unambiguously state it is a SHOULD.</code></pre><p>The original TCP RFC 793 says they should be ACKed "without undue delay" and suggests piggybacking if possible (page 73). Any RFC 2581-compliant TCP stack is mandated to ACK inside of 500 ms though.</p><p>Also, as a general comment it is almost always best to go to the RFC or white paper if you have a question on a firm rule for a protocol. Especially in multi-vendor scenarios it's a universal language between them, and suppliers/vendors will usually agree to be bound by them in a negotiation as well.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>18 Jun '14, 20:43</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f533c5f20f9c9afbf4b03de08a100e11?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Quadratic&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Quadratic<br />

With *nix systems its heavily dependend on the exact system, but in most cases you will also be able to see a "pattern" within an ongoing data transfer.</p><p>So every stack has its own behaviour about when and how to ACK incoming data, but all have in common that they try to ACK regularly and early so that the transmission keeps flowing.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>18 Jun '14, 11:22</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/36b41326bff63eb5ad73a0436914e05c?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="Landi&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>Landi<br />
