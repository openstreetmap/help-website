<p>Go to www.openstreetmap.org and try to find your business using the search function (or zoom to the correct location).</p>
<p>If your business is not on the map then OSM does not have information about your business. Frequently, third-party sites use an OSM background map and add their own business markers on top, leading to the misconception that the business information is from OSM when in fact it comes from a third party.</p>
<p>If you do find your business on OSM, you can sign in (create an account first if you don't have one yet), then click "edit" and remove the business. Be careful to not remove too much - for example, if your business information is linked to a building, delete just the business information and not the building (unless it has been demolished).</p>

<p>"If your business is not on the map then OSM does not have information about your business." - it's mostly true, but there are plenty of businesses in the database that don't have an icon on the map.</p>
