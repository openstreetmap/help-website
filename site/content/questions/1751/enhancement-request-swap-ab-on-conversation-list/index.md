However, sometimes the server shows up as "PortA" and sometimes as "PortB", which makes it hard to sort the data by the number of database bytes requested. Now, my guess is that WS picks up the FIRST packet in the conversation and makes the source A and target B. Would be really beneficial to be able to right-click on a line item and swap A for B, to then make sorting the data a bit more meaningful. Swapping wouldn't need to be saved -- could be stored only as long as the data is available in the dialog box.</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags">endpoints enhancement conversationlist</div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>14 Jan '11, 10:10</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a049f24820d77d7b560a4f67f02541b4?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="BtrieveBill&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>BtrieveBill<br />
