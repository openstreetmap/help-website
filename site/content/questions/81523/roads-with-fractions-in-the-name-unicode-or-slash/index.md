<p>Should these extra names be in alt_name or ref? What about buildings along the road, should their addresses contain the unicode or the typed out fractions?</p>

<p>Definitely not "40.5"... For your interest, my place uses <code>–</code> (U+2013: EN DASH) for <code>name:en=</code> in cases where it's not a hyphenated word.</p>

<p>While 40.5 is very ugly, "40 and a half" is probably the actual designation. Typically it is actually halfway between road 40 and road 41. 40.5 unfortunately is easy to type and search for exact name matches and the 1/2 will tend to screw up partial and fuzzy name searches.</p>
<p>The main reason I'm also against 40.5 is that I've seen "third" road names which has no finite length decimal expansion notation. Luckily third does have unicode, but there's no certainty each fraction has a unicode equivalent, so only the slash notation is clearest.</p>
<p>I don't recall seeing anything divided more than fourths or fifths so perhaps doing 1/17 won't be a concern.</p>
