<p>So the relevant part of <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/">the OSM licence</a> is section 4.3:</p>
<blockquote>
if you Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work <strong>reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database</strong>, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this License.
</blockquote>
<p>(emphasis mine)</p>
<p>So if it's in the 'About' page will that ensure that "people that use the map" aware that it's OSM? I'm not sure it is. Putting it in the corner isn't a massive requirement, is it?</p>

<p>Exactly. If you're being given the best geodata in the world for free, it's really, really miserly and ungrateful to say "ok, yes, and I don't want to add a visible credit either".</p>
<p>If you want to avoid showing a credit, you can phone TomTom or HERE and ask how much they'll charge for their data.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/5/richard">@Richard</a>: It's not "miserly" to want to give users the best possible experience, and let's be frank: No one wants to have their screen space wasted on legalese. As a long-time OSM contributor, it makes me sad that OSM-based apps will always be uglier than they could be if it wasn't for the inflexible rules on attribution placement.</p>

<p>The best possible map experience is achieved by ensuring the best possible map data. To get that, we need the virtuous feedback loop: users are aware that their map is made from OSM data; they see something that can be added; they go to OSM and make that change; the map gets better; and so on. Visible attribution is how that happens: if it's squirreled away in an About box, people don't know to go to OSM to make the change. In an age of 2000x1000px mobile screens, a little '©OpenStreetMap' isn't "wasting screen space on legalese", it's ensuring that our map - and hence the app they're using - continues to improve.</p>
<p>But this is better suited for the mailing lists. :)</p>
