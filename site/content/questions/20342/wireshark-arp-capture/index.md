Then you need to make a distinction between communicating to a system in the same subnet and a system that is not in your network. Pay attention to how packets are routed. You should now be able to tell for yourself which arp request and response are the ones that you should display with your filter.</p><p>Now you need to figure out a way to filter these packets. Look at the fields in the ARP request and reply and determine which fields you should filter on and use the "apply as filter..." options when right-clicking on the fields on which you would like to filter. Use "and" and "or" and "and not" and "or not" etc to construct the filter.</p><p>Good luck!</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>11 Apr '13, 12:15</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7901a94d8fdd1f9f47cda9a32fcfa177?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="SYN-bit&#39;s gravatar image" /><p>SYN-bit ♦♦<br />

When requesting a web page, your system needs to communicate to the web server. In order to reach the web server you need to communicate either with the server itself (if it is in the same subnet) or you need to communicate with a gateway that forwards your packet towards the webserver. Either way your client needs to communicate to a system on the same physical network and therefor must translate an IP address into a mac-address... and voila, there is your ARP traffic.</p><p>But I guess I'm now spoiling all the learning fun of finding out what the assignment was really about...</p></div><div id="comment-20350-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(11 Apr '13, 13:54)</span> SYN-bit ♦♦</div></div><span id="20355"></span><div id="comment-20355" class="comment"><div id="post-20355-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>we can see(As Kurt mentioned) Arp trigger and DNS trigger once we clear associated caches(arp and dns) but what if the static arp is configured?what if arp entry didn't timed out on a machine?.In that sense i mentioned it is not always possible to map/marry arp and web request tracking.
