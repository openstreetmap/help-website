To do this, I am attempting to isolate the low-level commands and send them to the device with a laptop running a modern OS using LabVIEW and NI-VISA.</p><p>I have run and successfully captured the USB data. Trying to send a simple command (<strong>GET DESCRIPTOR Request DEVICE</strong>) I have run in to two problems that I was hoping the community could help me out with:</p><p>First, though the command I am sending is the same, the pseudoheader length has changed. On the XP laptop, this command took 36 bytes, on the modern OS it is taking 35 and the byte right before the command I am sending is missing. This byte is described by Wireshark as <strong>Control transfer stage: Setup (0)</strong>. If I add the appropriate byte before the data I am sending, it becomes part of my data instead of the pseudoheader as it does in XP. What could I be doing wrong here? Could it be the NI-VISA from LabVIEW? There is the option to use a <strong>Write to USB Port</strong> versus <strong>VISA Write</strong> which is what I am using.</p><p>Next, while I have deciphered parts of the data being sent over (pseudoheader length, data size, data direction), there are some that differ between XP and the modern OS that I don't understand. Mostly these descriptions start with URB and IRP and I cannot find a definition on the site or in the Wireshark manual. Could anyone explain to me what these acronyms and their subcategories mean? All the ones I need help with are included below:</p><p>IRP ID</p><p>IRP USBD_STATUS</p><p>URB FUNCTION</p><p>Endpoint</p><p>Direction (Endpoint)</p><p>URB transfer type</p><p>Control transfer Stage</p><p>I have my captures for the XP and modern OS as well as a beakdown of the data as well as I have been able to make it.

(no offense here; being familiar with this section is mandatory for your task). The most important thing is that USBPcap pseudoheader never ever gets seen by USB device.</p><p>After looking at files I have to admit that you are completely mistaking some USB concepts. There are four different transfer types: Control, Interrupt, Isochronous and Bulk. These transfers are <em>COMPLETELY DIFFERENT</em> and <em>CANNOT BE INTERCHANGED</em> with each other.</p><p>I don't know if you can achieve your goal with LabView. You would have to get dirty with driver development. If the device does not use isochronous transfers you could write the driver using WinUSB. If it does, or if you don't like WinUSB, you can use libusb-win32.</p></div><div class="answer-controls post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>answered <strong>31 Jul '13, 09:34</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/96637248dab9a269e98fbf0344e26a93?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="desowin&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>desowin</span><br />
