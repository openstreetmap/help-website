Everything works perfectly until...</p><p>I'm setting up a dedicated monitor port to connect to my Cisco lab, using an additional NIC on the PC and installing Wireshark/winpcap. That in itself works, but I start to get a lot of network problems:</p><p>. Pages in my browser (Firefox and IE) often fail to load compeltely, or I get a page of code, a page that never stops loading or just a blank page. . Images in web pages often look garbled or truncated. . Sometimes I get browser errors such as SSL failures or page encoding errors. . FTP transfers (in any client) give corrupt or truncated files, without giving any error messages. . Problems browing fileshares on the LAN and using RDP.</p><p>The above happen so often that it's completely obvious there's a problem, and when it started. I've just done a system restore to before installing Wireshark/winpcap, and everything is back to normal.</p><p>I didn't change anything in wireshark's configuration and the only thing I did to the NIC was to disable all the services in network properties. I don't know if that's the right thing to do, but it seems to work for a quiet monitor port and I cannot see how it should cause my problems. Besides, even after reinstating all the network protocols I still had the problems, until I did the roll-back.</p><p>Any hints as to what to look for here? I'm about to start single-stepping through setting this up again, to see if I can isolate the cause.

</p></blockquote><p>I see two possible problems:</p><p><strong>P1:</strong> If the problems only occurs while you capture traffic, it could be related to <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Enable-IP-Routing">IP forwarding</a> being enabled on the Monitoring PC, which will then inject the monitored packets into the network again.</p><p><strong>P2:</strong> The monitoring port on your switch could be an access port. Some switches don't disable access functionality on monitor ports. So, your PC would get a second IP address from the same subnet via DHCP with a second default route, which could cause problems (depends on the metric of the default routes). You'll see that with <strong>ipconfig /all</strong>.</p><p>In both cases, please disable the IPV4 and IPV6 bindings on the NIC you are using to capture traffic to prevent those problems.</p><p>Regards<br />
