However, I want to filter this trace on IP address of the encoder and that specific serial port that the camera is attached to it . The reason is that I have many other cameras attached to this encoder as well but on different port. How can I do a trace with a filter on a specific serial port through wireshark and how to know the port number? what is the syntax ? should i use the UDP port ? If yes, is this UDP port is different than the others used by other cameras ?</p></div><div id="question-tags" class="tags-container tags"><span class="post-tag tag-link-ip" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;ip&#39;">ip</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-udp" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;udp&#39;">udp</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-serial" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;serial&#39;">serial</span> <span class="post-tag tag-link-trace" rel="tag" title="see questions tagged &#39;trace&#39;">trace</span></div><div id="question-controls" class="post-controls"></div><div class="post-update-info-container"><div class="post-update-info post-update-info-user"><p>asked <strong>25 Sep '12, 11:34</strong></p><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef848df11661133e157e3711063e4562?s=32&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=g" class="gravatar" width="32" height="32" alt="souss&#39;s gravatar image" /><p><span>souss</span><br />

And even then I doubt we can help you; this is clearly something you need to take to the vendor of the camera equipment I'm afraid.</p></div><div id="comment-14519-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(25 Sep '12, 15:00)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Jasper ♦♦</span></div></div><span id="14529"></span><div id="comment-14529" class="comment"><div id="post-14529-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>thanks Jasper for your reply,</p><p>In fact yes I do know the UDP port of each camera that is different and yes it is something known by the vendor(he provides it). However I just paid attention that I made a mistake by naming the serial port and asking about it. The reason is : the communication will always be on one serial port as we are treating one IP address. However I might use the UDP port to see this kind of commnication if i need to see a video stream communication .. However if i wanted to see a TCP connection communication I would choose just the IP address of the encoder as it is the only unit that will communicate through the serial link.</p><p>I beleive that I originally wrote the question wrongly, I was asking in fact if we can know on a specific physical port if we can monitor the traces and how to see them on one particular camera. here, I can agree with you that it must be the unique UDP port specified by the vendor. However I was wondering how can I know or trace the TCP communication without UDP (= video) between one camera on a specific physical port and the encoder itself</p><p>Please tell me if im mistaken or if I missed any confusing detail</p><p>Thanks agian and sorry about that</p><p>souss</p></div><div id="comment-14529-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(25 Sep '12, 22:24)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">souss</span></div></div><span id="14530"></span><div id="comment-14530" class="comment"><div id="post-14530-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>One more thing, when I said in my last answer camera, I meant the PTZ motor also as it is the root of the issue</p></div><div id="comment-14530-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(25 Sep '12, 22:26)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">souss</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-14514" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-14514-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
