<p>Just asking as you didn't mention it explicitly: did you download and install the additional <em>OsmAnd Contour lines</em> plugin? It's a separate app in Google Play! Also did you choose a minimum zoom level and zoom in close enough to see the contour lines?</p>
<p>Check <a href="http://code.google.com/p/osmand/wiki/DisplayContourLinesAndHillshades">http://code.google.com/p/osmand/wiki/DisplayContourLinesAndHillshades</a> for more details.</p>

<p>On OsmAnd you'll need to go into your settings and under "configure screen" select "map style" and then in there select "high-detail-topo". And also under "configure screen" click "show contour lines" and set the zoom level where you'd like them to appear. At least that works for me using both OsmAnd 1.5 and the latest 1.7.5</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer. I'm using v1.7.5 but under Map Style, I don't see a 'high-detail-topo' option. I have 'topo-map-assimilation' and I've selected that, but it doesn't seem to have changed anything.</p>

<p>Hey, I am having the same issue, but with a different map. I already posted my question here, but without an answer the thread got closed saying "This was not the right place to ask this, Osmand is its own thing, contour lines have nothing to do with Open street map, the google groups page is responsible for Osmand". No one there seems to be able to help me, but I couldn't help but notice a similarity btween your and my case. You see I have the same issue wih the map "<em>Canada_british-columbia-SW_northamerica.srt.obf</em>". Both mine and your maps contain underscores as well as a hyphen (" - "). I wonder if that hyphen has anything to do with the issue? Can a developer please look at this please? Changing the file name didn't so anything. Also, I could always tell that the map didn't even got loaded in the first place, because it wasn't displayed in <strong>bold font</strong>, as the loaded vector maps are. Also, when I click a bold fonted map, I see additional info, not the case with the contour lines map, except if I make the program think it is a vector map by moving it in the main folder and removing the "srtm" ending. In that case the map loads and I see a bunch of coordinates under additional info, but I still can't see any contour lines. The additional info is cryptic, If you want to see screenshots, look at my google groups question, it's called "contour lines not loading - tried everything", i posted screenshots a couple posts down.</p>

<p>Hi SpadRess, I just wanted to confirm that I am now seeing my contours. I'm not sure what I changed really, or why they came on, but I do see them now. I don't know which layer the contours are, but I now have 'underlay map' ticked in the layers, as well as hillshade layer. They might also have come on just when I searched for a different area away from my local area. Not sure if that triggered something. All a bit of a mystery to me. Very happy with it now though. Brilliant for out hiking in the hills.<br />

<p>In the latest version of Osmand, the contour lines plugin has changed. You have to enable it and then download the contours separately.</p>
<p>Under settings-&gt;Manage map files select "ALL DOWNLOADS" and then a pull down will appear at the top with "Regular maps" showing. In the pull down select "Contour lines".</p>
<p>Hill shade is in that same pull down if you want those too.</p>
<p>Instructions in the Google wiki and at the Android app page are wrong. It's pretty shitty when you're asking £2 for the plugin. I wouldn't complain if it was free.</p>

<p>Regarding contour lines and hill shading, at least in 2.0.4:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If you bring up the screen setup (layers looking icon on top left), is "Hillshade layer" checked?</p></li>
<li><p>In same menu a bit further down, what is the value of "Show contour lines"? (Mine is set to 11.)</p></li>
<li><p>If both of those are set, are your files correctly installed? Use a file explorer to look at the /sdcard/osmand directory. There should be a "srtm" subdirectory with your contour data files (names ending in .srtm.obf. There should be a "tiles" subdirectory also with one or more files with names like "Hillshade_something.sqlite.db"</p></li>
<li><p>I think you will also need to have the contour plug-in installed or the full (paid) version of osmand.</p></li>

<pre><code>If both of those are set, are your files correctly installed? Use a file explorer to look at the /sdcard/osmand directory. There should be a &quot;srtm&quot; subdirectory with your contour data files (names ending in .srtm.obf.</code></pre>
<p>H: I have that too</p>
<p>There should be a "tiles" subdirectory also with one or more files with names like "Hillshade_something.sqlite.db"</p>
<p>H: My file is named hillshade_sweden_europe.sqlitedb.download</p>
<p>H: I tried to open the file and got the message "unsupported filetype" Can this be a clue?</p>

<p>I think you will also need to have the contour plug-in installed or the full (paid) version of osmand. H: I have the plug-in installed of course, that's where everything started.But I have the free version of Osmand. Can that be the answer? I have tried to read in the google app shop about the difference between paid and unpaid but couldn't see this as being a difference.</p>
<p>H: please someone, our 3 months biketour through Europe starts in 1.5 week!!</p>

<p>So it looks like your download is in the wrong format? You could try downloading directly from here: <a href="http://osmand.net/srtm-countries/">http://osmand.net/srtm-countries/</a> <a href="http://download.osmand.net/hillshade/">http://download.osmand.net/hillshade/</a></p>
<p>Also, bike routes are available in Osmand. Just go to Map layers (symbol at top left of the screen), and tap on "Routes" to choose which types to display.</p>

<p>I can only redirect you to this google groupo thread (<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/osmand/hozspNCcrMI/-_JHJXY-DdsJ),">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/osmand/hozspNCcrMI/-_JHJXY-DdsJ),</a> where the same issue was more widely discussed and solved. In my particular area the nproblem was, that the definition of Britisch Columbia South-West was very unclear and inaccurate, and it acutally did not cover my area, even though I would consider it to be the SW of BC but apparently they didnt. Instead they considered it NW oder SE, I dont quite remember.</p>

<p>I had the same problem. Here's how I fixed it.</p>
<p>You have to download contour lines seperately for each region. Download Maps &gt; Search for desired region &gt; select it and you should see a list of additional downloads for that region (like wikipedia, roads only, contours, etc.).</p>
<p>Though I'm not sure if this is only the case for maps downloaded before you got the contour lines plugin.</p>
