<p>Hi !</p>
<p>I thought I've seen on the wiki that OSM doesn't need more to know than the year of the traces to be used. Unfortunately, I've seen that a long time ago and I can't find this piece of information again.</p>
<p>The idea of "anonimyzing" the time tags was to prevent users to be chased and to prevent pursuites because of speed infractions.</p>
<p>But, as I can't find again this on the wiki, I wanted to know if it's a good idea to leave only the year in the gpx files or if OSM needs to know all about times (hours, minutes and seconds) ?</p>
<p>Thanks !</p>
