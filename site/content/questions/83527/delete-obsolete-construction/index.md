<p>I suppose I can delete it. But what is the policy to delete old/obsolete/never-made constructions?</p>
<p>I have found under the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:construction">construction=*</a> and <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dconstruction">highway=construction</a> that we should map a feature 6 to 9 months in advance. What about several year projects, like a metro, or similar thing, but it was stopped?</p>

<p>I would start by putting a changeset comment on the changeset that added the area to ask if the editor that first added knew whether there had been any progess. If no reply and I had local knowledge that a project was definitely cancelled I'd then probably remove the area. In the days before notes construction areas were a useful way to mark where you knew something had been approved but needed repeated surveying to check when it was finished. These days, at least locally, we use notes instead. Sometimes it can be some years before approval and work starting - work started last year on a container port approved in 2010 (with 2021 expiry) which was approved before we were even monitoring local planning applications.</p>

<p>This depends on the progress. If no works has been started, it should not be added as a <code>=construction</code> in the first place. Whatever got built will remain, eg foundations, bridge segments, roads, and cleared land.</p>

<p>Yes, when I was a kid there was an uncompleted bridge over the Allegheny River from downtown Pittsburgh. It was known as "The Bridge to Nowhere". It eventually got finished: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Duquesne_Bridge">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Duquesne_Bridge</a></p>

<p>If the ground is not broken, the construction tag should not be used. Proposed is the correct tag. Personally I rarely bother as many projects never materialize, even after gaining funding &amp; planning. If there is a bridge structure, even if it it not in use, it should be mapped &amp; the access=no tag used.</p>
