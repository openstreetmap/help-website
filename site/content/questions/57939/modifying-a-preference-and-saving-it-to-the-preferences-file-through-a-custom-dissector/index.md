The dissector will not change the preferences based on packet content, but it will just inform the user through expert info that the values are different and use the new value within the dissector for further dissection. Sorry again for a misleading comment!</p><p>Now coming back to my initial question, the reason behind modifying the preferences through the dissector code is as follows. There are several preferences related to the custom protocol and I would like to provide the user with the possibility to change all of them at once (by having a separate drop-down preference that has different profiles corresponding to each set of values). Currently, when the user selects a profile option from the drop-down box and selects OK, the custom dissector will update the relevant preference values directly from the code. Even though the preference values are updated, they are not stored to the preferences file. To store it, the user has to open the protocol preferences and again select OK. Only then, the actual values are being stored.</p><p>It would be really helpful to know how to achieve the scenario that I have described above without the user having to open preferences again and selecting OK.</p><p>@Guy Harris: Yes, the custom dissector is the one modifying its own preferences</p></div><div id="comment-57961-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(08 Dec '16, 04:59)</span> sherlock_000</div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-57939" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-57939-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

There's no form of magic that detects stores into preference variables and causes the preferences to be saved, and <code>prefs_set_pref()</code> is intended to be used to handle command-line arguments that set a preference <em>for the instance of Wireshark/TShark to which the argument is passed</em>, so it intentionally does <em>not</em> save the preferences.</p><p>If the idea is that the protocol has some "profiles" such that several preferences should have particular values with that profile, then there are a couple of possibilities:</p><p>1) if there are no interesting values for those preferences <em>other</em> than the ones for the profile, you could just get rid of the other preferences and have just the profile preference;</p><p>2) if it's useful to have <em>most</em>, but not <em>all</em>, of the preferences in the question set to the appropriate value for the profile, you might be able to have one of the possible values for each of those preferences be "use the default value for the profile".</p></div><div id="comment-57977-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(09 Dec '16, 01:25)</span> Guy Harris ♦♦</div></div><span id="57979"></span><div id="comment-57979" class="comment"><div id="post-57979-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>I am not able to understand your second suggestion.
