It just means that the infrastructure behind the AP redirects any http GETs coming from a given user to the infrastructure's own web login page, and blocks any non-http traffic from the IP address the AP has assigned to that user, until that user logs in at this "welcome to our WiFi" page (or just clicks "I accept the conditions of use of this WiFi", whatever). After successfully forcing the user to fill in the required data and accept the conditions of use, the infrastructure starts routing all traffic from/to that user's IP transparently.</p><p>So between the user device and the AP, the http GET always contains the IP address of the real destination even before they log in (unless the infrastructure would respond DNS queries about the servers' fqdns with extremely short-lived answers pointing to its own web server).</p><p>Whether the WiFi connection between the clients and the AP is encrypted or not is an independent issue. Usually it isn't, because</p><ul><li><p>in public WLANs, client security is not the WLAN owner's key concern,</p></li><li><p>in enterprise WLANs, browser login is rarely used because client security and access control are addressed together, e.g. using individual WPA keys.</p></li></ul></div><div id="comment-49432-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(21 Jan '16, 04:17)</span> sindy</div></div><span id="49455"></span><div id="comment-49455" class="comment"><div id="post-49455-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Owh I'm sorry, i forgot to mention, after i login(browser login) by typing by id and password, i can only capture my packets, not other user's packets.
