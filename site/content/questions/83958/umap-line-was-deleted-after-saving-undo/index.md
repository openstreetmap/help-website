<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I created a relatively large map with many different lines in my account. Today I drew a relatively long route and when I saved it, the entire route was simply deleted. I saved the line several times in between and expanded it with the continuation of the line. Lost 3 hours of work. Is there a way to undo this???</p>
<p>Have also tried older links to the site where the line is no longer there.</p>
<p>And I'm also relatively new to OSM, so I don't know much about it.</p>
<p>Please help me, I am desperate.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>By now this won't help the OP, but for others like me who stumbled upon this unanswered question, there might be hope.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the feature was previously saved and you deleted it, then just hit CANCEL instead of SAVE at the top.</li>
<li>In my case, I deleted something that had been saved before and hit SAVE on accident. I got it back by restoring a previous version of the layer by going to Manage Layers (stack of discs on right-hand sidebar)&gt; Edit (pencil next to desired layer)&gt; Versions and the clicking on the list of dates that appears.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you created a feature and deleted it without ever saving it, I don't know of anything that can be done.</p>
