<p>Hello</p>
<p>In order to plan mountainbike trips with my 6-year-old kid, I would like to have a map overview where the trails, which are appropriate for mountainbiking (and where mountainbiking is allowed) are indicated. Optionally, it would be nice to also have a direct overview of the difficulty. When switching on the "Cycle Map" layer, there are only a few trails shown in my region, but in practice there are many more of course. We have already tested some. I tried to add them to openstreetmap, adding the tags mtb:scale, mtb:type to the trails, but they do not show up anywhere, only if I query the given trail.</p>
<p>So my question is: what is the best/standard way to enter mtb-related info to openstreetmap in such a way that I can then visualize mtb trails on an overview map?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>(sorry, I am posting this question for the 3rd time, I hope it will now succeed)</p>

<p>Have you looked at mtb.waymarkedtrails.org? It shows trails that have been mapped as route relations. By looking at how trails that appear on that map have been napped and tagged, you may get some ideas for the new trails you are mapping.</p>

<p>Hi Dan1967, your question ‘What’s the best way to ad a trail into OSM’, it should be a marked route with a kind of markers along the trail. Routes are only routes if they have been waymarked so that all can see or check if its in good guided condition. That rules out the ways without any signs. For the difficulties of a trail, follow Alan's hint they will use some but for a 6 year old cyclist ?</p>
