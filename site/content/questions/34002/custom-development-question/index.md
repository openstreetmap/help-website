My hope is that by using Wireshark I can find events that occur on the network and then create a front-end that would present those events using plain English. Maybe the best way to illustrate this is with a small use case. Pretend that Wireshark identified a network pattern that indicated a threat/event of some sort; the idea would be to then make my application aware of that threat and my application would translate the event into a workflow that was relevant and presented in a UI that assumed no knowledge of networks or the underlying technologies. The net of it is that I would like to use Wireshark as my backend engine, so that I don't have to recreate all the amazingly great things it does. I have been thinking of maybe using WinPCap as an alternative if I can't use WireShark, but am not that familiar with it and have to believe that Wireshark is more advanced overall, given the WinPCap is just a networking library. The warning you give about the stability of the Wireshark library, changing between releases though is a little vexing, but still might be viable if we can track the changes and deal with them in our releases...obviously not ideal. If there are other alternatives or approaches I would be happy to hear about them...thanks for taking the time to post the reply above...truly appreciated.</p></div><div id="comment-34008-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(20 Jun '14, 17:59)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">JGo</span></div></div></div><div id="comment-tools-34002" class="comment-tools"></div><div class="clear"></div><div id="comment-34002-form-container" class="comment-form-container"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

If that is the case, Wireshark is probably not the best tool for you. Wireshark was developed as a tool to do network troubleshooting by looking at frames. It supports that process by the huge number of protocol dissectors, which makes if also interesting as a tool for network security. However some internals have been created with a 'manual' troubleshooting tool in mind, so it's possible use as an IDS are kind of limited.</p><p>So, your options are:</p><ul><li>use libwireshark in your code and see how far you can get. See the links in my answer to another question: <a href="http://ask.wireshark.org/questions/33630/library-for-display-filters">http://ask.wireshark.org/questions/33630/library-for-display-filters</a></li><li>use tshark to print some of the dissector results. Then parse that output with your tool and create 'human readable' results. See the answer of <span>@hoangsonk49</span> in the following question: <a href="http://ask.wireshark.org/questions/25091/wireshark-tshark-out-of-memory-problem#33959">http://ask.wireshark.org/questions/25091/wireshark-tshark-out-of-memory-problem#33959</a> . He claims, that he has managed to run tshark for ~9 months to analyze network 'event', though that are (most certainly) different events than the ones you are looking for. Nevertheless, maybe you can use his method as well.</li><li>use a real IDS like <a href="https://www.snort.org/">snort</a>, <a href="http://www.bro.org/">bro</a> or <a href="http://suricata-ids.org/">suricata</a></li></ul><p>Regards<br />
