<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am new to OSM but am really excited by the project, I am trying to update my Garmin with USA maps. I started the program OSM Garmin Maps Generator 1.2.255 and selected the regions I wanted. It downloaded those with no issue. The planet update it was trying to download was Planet-130313.osm.pdf but the torrent was unsuccessful. I then downloaded (on my own, not thru OSM Maps Generator) planet-130206.osm.pbf. My question is this.</p>
<p>When I retart the program it checks the regions and contours but I cannot find a way to get the program to recognize the older Planet version and continue with generating the maps and creating the gmapsupp.img for my selected regions.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, I have searched and read until my eyes are crossing and am at a loss.</p>
