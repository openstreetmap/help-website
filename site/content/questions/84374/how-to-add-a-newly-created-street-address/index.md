<p>Is there a list of standard tag names? I created my own tags by accident for street address. The beginner guide didn't seem to cover each of the steps. I just used the standard editor and some pulldown items for descriptions.</p>

<p>I'm not seeing any answers when I open my question, just email with the comment. I've hit SUBSCRIBE ME several times but no new answers are showing up in the original question.

<p>From email: Hello SaltWaterBill, TZorn has just posted a comment on the question How to add a newly created street address? The standard editor iD should already give you all the usual tags. Not sure where you had need to create own ones. Can you link to your edits so we can take a look? Don't forget to come over and cast your vote.</p>
<hr />
<p>The standard editor pulldown didn't have any items related to street address. So I just added what I thought would work, hoping that the editor would suggest the right one. However, I just found the addr: popups and have added them to the parking lot and driveway.</p>
<p>I don't know what "link to your edits" means. Under the share button, I see this Link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/45.60104/-123.94577&amp;layers=NDG.">https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/45.60104/-123.94577&amp;layers=NDG.</a></p>
<p>I also don't know what "cast your vote" means.</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide">Beginners' Guide</a> for a quick overview. Essentially, go to www.opentreetmap.org, create an account if you have not done so already, zoom to the area of the trailhead and click the edit button. There is a small tutorial you can follow to learn how to do your first edit. You map the parking lot, a service road from the highwhay across the parking lot and a path connecting that service road with the trail. Depending on what has been mapped previously you might bave to change or repurpose some of the existing ways.</p>

<p>I have reviewed your edits. You made some beginners' mistakes but they are easy to fix.</p>
<p>The editor did not suggest address fields for you as you were trying to add them to features that don't usually get them.</p>
<p>Let's start with the driveway. That should really only be tagged with <code>highway=service</code> and <code>service=parking_aisle</code>. If it has a name of its own (I doubt it) it would go into the tag <code>name=xyz</code>. You may add the <code>surface</code> or any access restrictions (no trucks etc) or whether it is lit nor not. But the driveway doesn't get address information. (1/2)</p>

<p>The parking lot itself has somehow not been tagged as such but as a wetland. Not sure how that could have happened. Please go back to the editor. Click on the line making up the parking lot and then in the left side bar click on the object type wetland at the top (I have to translate here, so things might be termed slightly differently for you). You should now be able to search for parking lot by typing in the search field. Once parking lot comes up in the list below click on it. Now below you see all the typical fields that get usually tagged. Take a look if you can fill in any. You can always click the information button to the right of each field for explanations.</p>
<p>Then please scroll down to the bottom of that list and expand the All Tags list. Delete everything referring to the wetland (<code>wetland</code>, <code>salt</code>, <code>tidal</code>).</p>
<p>Hope that helps. There is also some useful information on <a href="https://learnosm.org">learnosm.org</a> (2/2)</p>

<p>That is pretty easy to do.</p>
<p>Merely create an object, either a node or an area, to represent the parking lot and add address data to that object.</p>
<p>Possible tags are:</p>
<p>amenity=parking</p>
<p>addr:street=Street Name</p>
<p>addr:housenumber=xxx</p>
<p>addr:city=city name</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>Does that answer your question?</p>

<p>I think all the edits are correct now. Removed an extraneous jog in the trail. I intended to just edit the parking lot and road from the highway into the lot. Added street address and removed incorrect tags.</p>
