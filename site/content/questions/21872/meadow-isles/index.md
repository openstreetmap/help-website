<p>I have discovered several untagged but quite huge farmland areas. They are already drawn but tend to be inaccurate because no diffence has been made between farmland and meadow areas. However, there are tagged scrubs included as "isles" - holes in farmland areas. How can I make such "isles"? I would like to draw the meadows as "holes" in the already existing farmland areas so that they don't overlap. Is this possible or do I have to delete everything and draw it newly to distinguish between farmland and meadows? (I'm using Potlatch 2.)</p>

<p>Have a look at the Potlatch 2 example on <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:multipolygon">this page</a> - there are a series of screenshots that explain what you need to do.</p>

<p>Thank you. Is it possible to "cut off" an area at some point? E. g. if I want to "transform" part of an area into a new area?</p>

<p>That should probably be a different question. In Potlatch 2 add a node to the existing area where you want to cut the area, then user the scissors tool to cut the area. You end up with two ways that aren't areas any more and you need to draw from the end of each to close them again. It might be that the other end of the way isn't where you want it either in which case you need to cut at that point too, at which point you will have three ways, two of which are for the same new area. Shift click each and use the join button in the toolbox before extending the two to an area again.</p>
