<p>My question concerns <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Highway_System#Numbering">North Carolina secondary road numbers</a>. As Wikipedia says, these roads generally have both a name and a number. Addresses, directions, and mentions in conversation all use the name; the number is almost exclusively used by government employees.</p>
<p>In rural areas, the numbers are indicated in the form "SR 1615" on street signs, to the left of the name. Since they're physically marked, I figure the numbers should be tagged as <strong>ref=SR 1615</strong>. So far, so good.</p>
<p>In suburban and urban areas, however, the numbers have been deliberately excluded from street signs. The numbers are still present in street databases from all levels of government. Because the numbers are no longer physically present or used by anyone other than government employees, I figure they no longer deserve <strong>ref</strong>; since they were presumably once signed, they should instead be tagged with <strong>old_ref</strong>. <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/jumbanho">jumbanho</a> alerted me that other people have been using <strong>unsigned_ref</strong> instead. I see a few uses of <strong>unsigned_ref</strong> and no uses of <strong>old_ref</strong> for NC secondary roads (except my own). Which tagging, if either, is best?</p>

<p>Hi yotann, unsigned ref as you stated seems to be the right tag. Old ref is since they have been numbered a misleading value. If there’s no change in officially maintenance and a decision to unref them they probably still do have a ref.</p>

<p>Well, I still doubt anyone is actually using the numbers, but I guess if they're in databases and on maintenance maps that's enough reason to use unsigned_ref instead of old_ref.</p>

<p>Look at it this way yotann, these ways did or do have a ref but you’re not able to find a sign of it. Until there’s a legal and published decision with a withdrawal, their refs still legal isnt it ?</p>
