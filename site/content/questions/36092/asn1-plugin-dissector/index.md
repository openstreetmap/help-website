And then of course you must edit the packet-toyasn1-template.c file and replace the call to dissect_TOYASN1_MESSAGE_PDU() by whatever function you defined as a PDU in the .cnf file. This .cnf file contains the magic allowing asn2wrs tool to know what is the top PDU for your protocol and which dissect_XXX_PDU functions should be generated.</p></div><div id="comment-36120-info" class="comment-info"><span class="comment-age">(09 Sep '14, 11:18)</span> <span class="comment-user userinfo">Pascal Quantin</span></div></div><span id="36133"></span><div id="comment-36133" class="comment not_top_scorer"><div id="post-36133-score" class="comment-score"></div><div class="comment-text"><p>Hi Pascal Quantin, Thanks for your reply.
