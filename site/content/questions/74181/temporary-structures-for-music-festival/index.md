<p>An editor has carefully tagged about 35 or more nodes with "amenity=theatre" at the site of a large music festival. (They have also done a nice job on the permanent tracks and boundaries.) These stages and tents are present for three to four days once a year, a little longer during construction and deconstruction, and there is no permanent structure the rest of the time. They won't be there at all this year (2020).</p>
<p>I don't want to be an arse, but I don't think these "theatres" should be on the map. Thoughts? Is there any kind of compromise tagging that would be more appropriate?</p>

<p>Your approach (not to add such structures) is certainly the more common one. Some festivals (e.g. Glastonbury) have some multiple-use structures that are there all year and are mapped; most do not.</p>
<p>That said, I don't think a question like this is a good fit for this help site (it doesn't really have an answer; people just have opinions). I'd suggest mentioning it on a local mailing list or forum, and also mention it to the person who added it, saying that most people don't add such things to OSM, and perhaps a service like <a href="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/">uMap</a> would be a better fit for what they want?</p>

<p>I think the 'most transient' thing that is commonly mapped are Christmas Markets? But they tend to last more than a few days.</p>
