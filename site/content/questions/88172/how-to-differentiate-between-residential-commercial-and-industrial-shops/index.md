<p>How can I tag a node in OSM to differentiate between shops that sell goods that cater to only one of the following types of customers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Residential</li>
<li>Commercial</li>
<li>Industrial</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, let's consider a shop that sells ovens.</p>
<p>A single home owner is going to be looking for a shop to buy <strong>a residential oven</strong>. A residential oven is less than one cubic meter. It fits under the counter in a home. It has a fairly inexact range of temperatures and few features. These types of ovens work fine for most homes, but it's not going to suffice for a business that needs to bake 700 loaves of bread per day.</p>
<p>A bakery is going to be looking to be looking for a shop to buy a <strong>commercial oven</strong>. A commercial oven is going to be fairly large, possibly a few cubic meters. It will have finer control of its temperatures and have some advanced features, such as steam control. This would be too large &amp; expensive for a single home, but it's not going to suffice for a business that needs to produce tens of thousands of loaves per day.</p>
<p>A large-scale industrial bread manufacturer is going to be looking for a shop that can help them build an <strong>industrial oven</strong>. An industrial oven is going to be extremely large, likely with a continuous-feed convener running loaves of bread through it constantly. It's going to need a host of computers to maintain its numerous heating elements, sensors, and advanced features.</p>
<p>Here, ovens is just an example. In general, almost every type of <code>shop=</code> that can be tagged on OSM can be split into these categories.</p>
<p>How can OSM contributors differentiate between shops that sell residential, commercial, and industrial goods with tags?</p>

<p>I would consider only the first place (selling to residential customers) to be a shop.</p>
<p>Buyers would surely go to either a factory or a commercial premises to buy a commercial or industrial oven?</p>

<p>In my country there are shops that sell residential kitchen supplies and shops that sell commercial kitchen supplies. The shop that sells commercial kitchen supplies is <em>not</em> a factory. Are you suggesting the shop that sells commercial kitchen supplies should not be listed on OSM at all?</p>

<p>No, I'm saying it's not a shop, as shops are for retail sales. I would tag the building a commercial building.</p>
