<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>In my organisation we love what you are doing in the project!</p>
<p>As such we would love to be able to give back to the project.</p>
<p>In the organisation we operate a platform managing very large fleet of vehicles, collecting thousands of trips every day mainly in Europe. As such i was wondering what either it might be worth exploring donating parts of the data set to the project in a anonymised format, for example splitting trips into 30-60s segments with additional pruning?</p>
<p>If so, would it be presumed that it would have any benefit at all? The data quality in OSM appears rather high to me, so perhaps it only makes sense to send GPS traces that you know is unmapped?</p>
<p>Or would there be some other use case where this kind of dataset would be applicable for the project?</p>
<p>If it has any interest i would love to hear more about how to get started. Or would the best way just be to upload all under one user at <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/traces">https://www.openstreetmap.org/traces</a> ?</p>

<p>Thank you for considering the data donation and such a contribution is naturally welcome.</p>
<p>I suspect that there are multiple ways the data could be used (depending on what kind of vehicles were actually used). For example such data can be used to find missing turn restrictions and in general for QA. Potentially it could be useful for aligning aerial imagery too.</p>
<p>As a result I think that simply making the data available as your suggest in an anonymised format would be a good start. In any case I think the discussion doesn't really fit on this forum and should moved to a suitable mailing list or forum.</p>
